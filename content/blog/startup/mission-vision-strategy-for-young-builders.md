Think of your product like a journey. You need three things to go far:

- **Mission**: why you're going (your purpose)
- **Vision**: where you're going (your future picture)
- **Strategy**: how you'll get there (your plan)

When these work together, your team knows what to do and why it matters.

## Mission: Your Big Why

Mission is your purpose. It answers: "Why does our product exist?" Keep it short and clear.

A good mission is:
- Simple and memorable
- Inspiring and meaningful
- True to what you do

Your mission guides every decision. When you're not sure what to do, ask: "Does this help us achieve our mission?"

## Vision: Your Future Picture

Vision is where you're going. It answers: "What does success look like?" It's a picture of the future you're trying to create.

A good vision is:
- Clear and specific
- Inspiring and ambitious
- Achievable but challenging

Your vision gives your team something to aim for. It helps them understand what they're working toward.

## Strategy: Your Step-by-Step Plan

Strategy is how you'll get there. It answers: "How will we achieve our vision?" It's your plan for turning your vision into reality.

A good strategy is:
- Clear and actionable
- Focused on what matters most
- Flexible enough to adapt

Your strategy guides your actions. It helps you decide what to do and what not to do.

## North Star: One Number to Follow

Your North Star is the one number that shows if you're on track. It's the metric that matters most for achieving your vision.

A good North Star is:
- Simple and easy to understand
- Directly connected to your vision
- Something you can measure

Your North Star helps you stay focused. When you're not sure what to do, ask: "Will this move our North Star?"

## Avoid "Innovation Theater"

Don't create mission, vision, and strategy just to have them. Make them real. Use them to guide decisions. Make them part of how you work.

If your mission, vision, and strategy don't guide your decisions, they're just words on a wall. They're "innovation theater"—they look good but don't actually help.

## The Principle

Mission, vision, and strategy work together to guide your product. Mission tells you why. Vision tells you where. Strategy tells you how. When these are clear and aligned, your team knows what to do and why it matters.
