Being an entrepreneur is like being a team of three inside one person: a smart thinker, a strong mover, and a creative heart. When all three work together, you can build amazing things — and feel good doing it.

## Why “You First” matters

Great companies are led by healthy people. Many founders feel stress and burnout. Taking care of yourself is not extra — it’s the foundation. When you feel good, you think better, choose better, and build better. See this short read on balancing mind, body, spirit for entrepreneurs [link](https://startupsmagazine.co.uk/article-simple-steps-entrepreneurs-can-take-rebalance-mind-body-and-spirit).

## Mind: Think like an entrepreneur

The entrepreneur’s mind is curious and brave. It learns every day and turns problems into chances.

Try these:
- Ask: “What did I learn today?” (one sentence)
- Write: one idea you want to try tomorrow
- Plan: one tiny step (so small it’s easy)

For a fun take on mind–body–soul harmony, read this piece on the entrepreneur’s mind, athlete’s body, and artist’s soul [link](https://medium.com/betterism/embracing-the-entrepreneurs-mind-athlete-s-body-and-artist-s-soul-7618b7d0ee9f).

## Body: Move like an athlete

Your body is your power source. Moving a little each day makes your brain sharper and your mood brighter.

Do this quick set:
- 10 squats
- 10 wall push-ups
- 30-second stretch

Drink water. Eat simple, real food. Take short walks. These tiny choices add up.

## Spirit: Create like an artist

Your spirit is what makes your work meaningful. It’s your “why.”

Try this:
- Close your eyes. Breathe slowly for 60 seconds.
- Ask: “Who am I helping today?”
- Make one small kind action.

## Your daily 10-minute routine

Use this 3-3-3-1 routine (10 minutes total):
- 3 minutes: write one thing you’re grateful for and one goal
- 3 minutes: move (squats, push-ups, stretch)
- 3 minutes: slow breathing with eyes closed
- 1 minute: choose one tiny step for your goal

## When life gets hard

Feeling tired, worried, or stuck is normal. That’s a signal to slow down and care for yourself. Talking to a counselor or mentor can help. Research shows that caring for mental well-being helps your learning, calm, and choices — all key for entrepreneurs. See research on entrepreneurial well-being and resilience [link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/26317877211005786).
