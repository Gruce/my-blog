Building a tech team in university is like having a practice field before the real game. You're surrounded by smart people, have access to resources, and can make mistakes without losing everything. It's the perfect time to learn how to lead, build, and ship real products.

## Why University is the Perfect Time

University gives you three superpowers for building a tech team:

**Access to talent**: Smart classmates who are learning the same things. Different skill levels. People with different backgrounds and interests.

**Low risk**: You can make mistakes without losing everything. You can try different approaches. You can learn what works and what doesn't.

**Resources**: Access to libraries, labs, professors, and other resources. You can learn from experts. You can get feedback on your work.

## What Makes a Great Tech Team

A great tech team has three things:

1. **Complementary skills**: People who can do different things. Frontend, backend, design, product. Each person brings something different.

2. **Shared vision**: Everyone understands what you're trying to build and why. They're aligned on the goal.

3. **Trust**: People trust each other. They can work together without micromanagement. They can disagree and still move forward.

## How to Find Your First Teammates

Start with your classmates. Look for people who are:

- Curious and eager to learn
- Reliable and committed
- Good at what they do
- Fun to work with

Don't just look for the smartest people. Look for people who are reliable, curious, and fun to work with.

## Building Your First Project Together

Start with a small project. Something you can build in a few weeks. Something that solves a real problem.

The key is to ship something. Don't try to build the perfect product. Build something that works, then improve it based on feedback.

## Learning to Lead and Manage

Leading a tech team is about:

- Setting clear goals
- Removing obstacles
- Making decisions
- Keeping everyone aligned

You don't need to be the best programmer. You need to be able to help the team work together and achieve their goals.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trying to do everything yourself
- Not communicating clearly
- Not setting clear goals
- Not shipping early and often
- Not learning from mistakes

## Turning Your Team into a Startup

If your team works well together and you've built something people want, you might have a startup. The key is to:

- Validate that people want what you've built
- Figure out how to make money
- Build a sustainable business model
- Scale the team as you grow

## The Principle

University is the perfect time to build a tech team. You're surrounded by smart people, have access to resources, and can make mistakes without losing everything. Start with a small project. Ship something. Learn from feedback. If it works, you might have a startup.
