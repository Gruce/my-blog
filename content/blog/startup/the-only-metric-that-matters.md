Most startups track too many numbers. Downloads, page views, sign-ups, revenue. But there's really only one question that matters: **Are people actually using your product?**

Josh Elman, who helped build Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, explains why most metrics are distractions and how to focus on what actually matters.

## The Problem with Most Metrics

Most startups track the wrong things:

- **Downloads**: How many people installed your app
- **Page views**: How many times people looked at your website
- **Sign-ups**: How many people created accounts
- **Revenue**: How much money you're making

These numbers look good in presentations, but they don't tell you if your product is actually working.

The problem: You can have millions of downloads but zero real users.

## The Only Question That Matters

There's really only one question you need to answer:

**Are people using your product?**

More specifically:
1. **Are they using it how you expect?** (performing the core action)
2. **Are they using it at the frequency you expect?** (coming back regularly)

If people aren't using your product the way you expect, or at the frequency you expect, then you don't have a product—you have a feature.

## Understanding User Behavior

User behavior tells you everything you need to know about your product. If people are using it regularly, you're on the right track. If they're not, you need to figure out why.

The key is to understand what makes users stick. What is the core action that delivers value? What is the frequency that indicates real engagement?

## The Three Types of Users

There are three types of users:

1. **Core users**: People who use your product regularly and get real value from it
2. **Casual users**: People who use your product occasionally but don't get much value
3. **Non-users**: People who signed up but never really used your product

Focus on understanding and growing your core users. They're the ones who will drive your product's success.

## How to Find Your Core Users

To find your core users, you need to understand what makes them different. What action do they take that others don't? What frequency do they use your product at?

Use the state diagram method: map out the different states users can be in, and understand what moves them from one state to another. This helps you identify the core action and the frequency that indicates real engagement.

## What Makes Users Stick

Users stick when they get real value from your product. The core action is what delivers that value. If users aren't performing the core action regularly, they won't stick.

The key is to make the core action as easy and valuable as possible. Remove friction. Add value. Make it obvious what users should do next.

## The Principle

The only metric that matters is whether people are actually using your product. If they're not using it regularly, nothing else matters. Focus on understanding and growing your core users, and everything else will follow.
