# The Only Metric That Matters: A Simple Guide

Most startups track too many numbers. Downloads, page views, sign-ups, revenue. But there's really only one question that matters: **Are people actually using your product?**

Josh Elman, who helped build Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, explains why most metrics are distractions and how to focus on what actually matters.

## The Problem with Most Metrics

Most startups track the wrong things:

- **Downloads**: How many people installed your app
- **Page views**: How many times people looked at your website
- **Sign-ups**: How many people created accounts
- **Revenue**: How much money you're making

These numbers look good in presentations, but they don't tell you if your product is actually working.

**The problem:** You can have millions of downloads but zero real users.

## The Only Question That Matters

There's really only one question you need to answer:

**Are people using your product?**

More specifically:
1. **Are they using it how you expect?** (performing the core action)
2. **Are they using it at the frequency you expect?** (coming back regularly)

Everything else is just noise.

## Understanding User Behavior

To understand if your product is working, you need to look at user behavior, not just numbers.

**Good behavior looks like:**
- People come back regularly
- They use your product the way you designed it
- They get value from it
- They tell others about it

**Bad behavior looks like:**
- People try it once and never come back
- They use it differently than you expected
- They don't get value from it
- They don't recommend it to others

## The Three Types of Users

Josh Elman found that users fall into three categories:

### 1. Cold Users
- Try your product once
- Never come back
- Don't get value from it
- **These users don't matter for growth**

### 2. Casual Users
- Use your product sometimes
- Might come back, might not
- Get some value but not consistently
- **These users are unpredictable**

### 3. Core Users
- Use your product regularly
- Come back consistently
- Get real value from it
- **These users drive your growth**

**The goal:** Turn as many users as possible into core users.

## How to Find Your Core Users

Here's how to identify which users are core:

### Step 1: Calculate Return Probability
Look at how likely someone is to return in the second month based on how many days they used your product in the first month.

Create a grid:
- **X-axis**: Days used in first month
- **Y-axis**: Probability of returning in second month

### Step 2: Find the Breaking Point
Look for the point where users are 90% or more likely to return. This is your "core user threshold."

**Example:** If users who visit 8+ days in the first month are 90% likely to return, then 8 days is your threshold.

### Step 3: Categorize Your Users
- **Cold**: Below the threshold, unlikely to return
- **Casual**: Near the threshold, might return
- **Core**: Above the threshold, highly likely to return

## The State Diagram Method

Once you know your user types, map how users move between categories:

### User State Transitions
- **New → Cold**: Most new users become cold
- **New → Casual**: Some become casual users
- **New → Core**: Few become core users
- **Casual → Core**: Casual users can become core
- **Core → Casual**: Core users can become casual (bad!)

### What You Want to See
- **High conversion from New to Core**: Most new users should become core users quickly
- **Low churn from Core**: Core users should stay core
- **Growth in Core users**: Your core user base should grow over time

## What Makes Users Stick

To understand what makes users stick, analyze what core users do differently:

### Key Actions That Matter
Look for actions that predict whether someone becomes a core user:

**Examples from Twitter:**
- Following 30+ people
- Having 10+ followers
- Tweeting regularly
- Engaging with others' tweets

**The pattern:** Core users do specific actions that casual users don't do.

### The "Aha Moment"
Find the moment when users understand your product's value:

- **Twitter**: When you follow enough people to see interesting content
- **Facebook**: When you connect with friends and see their updates
- **LinkedIn**: When you build a professional network

## Real Examples from Twitter

Josh Elman shared specific examples from Twitter:

### Example 1: Following People
- Users who follow 30+ people are much more likely to become core users
- This makes sense: you need content to see when you open Twitter

### Example 2: Getting Followers
- Users with 10+ followers are more likely to stick around
- This makes sense: you need an audience to feel like tweeting matters

### The Pattern
Core users do things that make the product more valuable to them. Casual users don't.

## How to Track the Right Things

Instead of tracking vanity metrics, track these:

### 1. Core User Conversion Rate
- What percentage of new users become core users?
- This is your most important metric

### 2. Core User Retention
- How many core users stay core users?
- This tells you if your product is sustainable

### 3. Core User Growth
- Is your core user base growing?
- This tells you if your product is scaling

### 4. Time to Core
- How long does it take for users to become core?
- Faster is better

## Common Metric Mistakes

Here are mistakes to avoid:

### 1. Tracking Vanity Metrics
- Downloads, page views, sign-ups
- These don't tell you if your product is working

### 2. Comparing to Benchmarks
- "Our retention is better than average"
- Every product is different

### 3. Focusing on Growth Over Engagement
- Getting more users who don't use your product
- Better to have fewer engaged users

### 4. Not Understanding User Behavior
- Not knowing why users stick around
- Not knowing why users leave

## Templates You Can Use

### Core User Analysis Template

**Step 1: Calculate Return Probability**
```
Days used in Month 1 → Probability of returning in Month 2
1 day → 20%
2 days → 35%
3 days → 50%
...
8 days → 90%
```

**Step 2: Find Your Threshold**
- Look for 90%+ return probability
- This is your core user threshold

**Step 3: Categorize Users**
- Below threshold = Cold
- Near threshold = Casual  
- Above threshold = Core

### User State Tracking Template

Track how users move between states:

| From State | To State | Percentage | Action Needed |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| New | Cold | 70% | Improve onboarding |
| New | Casual | 20% | Increase engagement |
| New | Core | 10% | This is your goal |
| Casual | Core | 30% | Help casual users |
| Core | Casual | 5% | Prevent churn |

### Weekly Core User Report

Track these every week:

1. **Core User Count**: How many core users do you have?
2. **New to Core Rate**: What % of new users become core?
3. **Core User Retention**: What % of core users stay core?
4. **Time to Core**: How long does it take to become core?

### Core User Actions Checklist

For each product, identify:

- [ ] What actions do core users take?
- [ ] What's the minimum threshold for each action?
- [ ] How can you help new users reach these thresholds?
- [ ] What happens if users don't reach these thresholds?

## The Bottom Line

Most metrics are distractions. The only thing that matters is whether people are actually using your product.

**Focus on:**
- Core user conversion rate
- Core user retention
- Core user growth
- What makes users stick

**Ignore:**
- Vanity metrics like downloads
- Benchmarks from other companies
- Metrics that don't predict behavior

**Remember:** It's better to have 1,000 core users than 100,000 users who never come back.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on usage, not vanity metrics**
2. **Identify your core users and what makes them stick**
3. **Track core user conversion, retention, and growth**
4. **Help new users become core users quickly**
5. **Understand why users leave and fix those problems**

**The only metric that matters:** Are people actually using your product?
