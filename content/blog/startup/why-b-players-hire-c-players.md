Steve Jobs once said that A-players hire A-players, and B-players hire C-players. It's one of the most quoted insights in Silicon Valley, but few people understand the deeper psychology behind why this happens.

Max Levchin, co-founder of PayPal and Affirm, has spent years thinking about this phenomenon and has uncovered the hidden truth: it's not about competence—it's about fear.

## The Psychology of A-Players

A-players are confident in their abilities. They're not threatened by other talented people. They want to work with the best because it makes them better.

When A-players hire, they look for people who are as good as or better than them. They want to build a team of the best people possible. They're not afraid of being outshined because they know that great teams make everyone better.

## The Psychology of B-Players

B-players are different. They're competent, but they're not confident. They're afraid of being outshined. They're afraid of being replaced.

When B-players hire, they look for people who are good enough but not too good. They want people who can do the work but won't threaten their position. They hire C-players because C-players make them look good.

## The Dangerous B-Player: Fear-Driven Hiring

The dangerous B-player is the one who hires based on fear. They hire people who won't challenge them, who won't outshine them, who won't threaten their position.

This creates a downward spiral. B-players hire C-players. C-players hire D-players. The team gets weaker and weaker. The company gets worse and worse.

## Why This Matters for Your Company

This matters because it determines the quality of your team. If you have B-players in hiring positions, they will hire C-players. Your team will get weaker over time.

The solution is to have A-players in hiring positions. A-players hire A-players. They build strong teams. They make the company better.

## How to Identify Fear-Driven B-Players

Fear-driven B-players have certain characteristics:

- They're threatened by talented people
- They hire people who are good enough but not too good
- They avoid hiring people who might outshine them
- They create teams that make them look good

If you see these characteristics, you have a B-player problem.

## Building a Culture of A-Player Hiring

To build a culture of A-player hiring, you need to:

1. **Hire A-players first**: Make sure your hiring managers are A-players. They will hire A-players.

2. **Reward A-player hiring**: Recognize and reward people who hire great talent. Make it clear that hiring great people is valued.

3. **Remove B-players from hiring positions**: If someone is hiring C-players, remove them from hiring positions. Don't let them weaken your team.

## The PayPal Mafia Approach

The PayPal Mafia understood this. They hired A-players. They built teams of the best people possible. They weren't afraid of being outshined because they knew that great teams make everyone better.

This is why they built so many successful companies. They understood that great teams are built by A-players who hire A-players.

## The Principle

A-players hire A-players because they're confident and want to work with the best. B-players hire C-players because they're afraid and want to protect their position. The solution is to have A-players in hiring positions. They will build strong teams and make the company better.
