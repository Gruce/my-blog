A platform is like a playground you build, where many people can come to play together—makers and users, buyers and sellers, drivers and riders. Your job is to make the rules fair, the tools helpful, and the place safe and fun. When more people join, the playground gets better for everyone.

## What is a Platform?

A platform connects two or more groups so they can help each other. Examples: riders and drivers, buyers and sellers, creators and fans. You don't make all the things yourself—you make it easy for others to make and share.

The key is that both sides need each other. Riders need drivers. Drivers need riders. Buyers need sellers. Sellers need buyers. The platform makes it easy for them to find each other and work together.

## Why Platforms are Powerful

Platforms can grow fast because of network effects: more people → more value for each person. When more riders join, the platform becomes more valuable for drivers. When more drivers join, the platform becomes more valuable for riders.

Over time, platforms can also become a standard or even a place where others build apps. This creates even more value and makes the platform harder to replace.

## Your "Unit of Value"

Your "unit of value" is the smallest thing that creates value for both sides. For Uber, it's a ride. For Airbnb, it's a stay. For YouTube, it's a video.

The key is to make it easy to create and consume this unit of value. The easier it is, the faster your platform will grow.

## How to Get Your First 1,000 Users

Getting your first users is hard because platforms need both sides. You need riders and drivers. You need buyers and sellers. You need creators and fans.

The solution is to focus on one side first. Get enough riders, then find drivers. Get enough buyers, then find sellers. Get enough creators, then find fans.

Once you have both sides, the network effects kick in. More people join because more people are already there.

## Designing for Big Impact

Platforms need to be designed for scale. They need to:

- Make it easy to join
- Make it easy to create value
- Make it easy to find what you need
- Make it safe and trustworthy

The easier you make it, the faster your platform will grow.

## Platform Product Skills

Building a platform requires different skills than building a regular product:

- **Network thinking**: Understanding how networks grow
- **Two-sided markets**: Understanding how to balance both sides
- **Trust and safety**: Making sure the platform is safe and trustworthy
- **Ecosystem thinking**: Understanding how the platform fits into a larger ecosystem

## The Principle

A platform connects two or more groups so they can help each other. The key is network effects: more people → more value for each person. Focus on one side first, then the other. Make it easy to create and consume value. When more people join, the platform gets better for everyone.
