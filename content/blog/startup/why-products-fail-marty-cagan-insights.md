Most products fail. Even with good teams, big budgets, and smart people. Marty Cagan, who worked at companies like eBay and Netscape, explains why this happens and how to fix it.

The problem isn't bad technology or lazy teams. It's how most companies think about building products.

## The Wrong Model

Most companies work like this:

1. Business decides what to build
2. Product writes requirements
3. Engineering builds it
4. Marketing sells it

This model fails because it assumes you know what to build before you've validated it. You're building based on assumptions, not evidence.

## The Business Case Fallacy

Most companies require a business case before building anything. This sounds reasonable, but it's actually backwards.

You can't know if something will work until you've built it and tested it with real users. Business cases are based on assumptions, not evidence. They create false confidence in ideas that haven't been validated.

## How Great Companies Actually Work

Great companies work differently:

1. Discovery: Figure out what to build
2. Delivery: Build it
3. Validation: Test it with real users
4. Iteration: Improve it based on feedback

The key difference: great companies validate before they build. They test assumptions with real users before committing to building anything.

## Two Types of Teams

There are two types of teams:

**Feature teams**: Teams that build what they're told to build. They execute on requirements without questioning them.

**Product teams**: Teams that figure out what to build. They own outcomes, not outputs. They're responsible for solving problems, not just building features.

Great companies have product teams, not feature teams.

## The Discovery Process

The discovery process is about figuring out what to build before you build it. It's about testing assumptions with real users and validating that you're solving a real problem.

The key is to get in front of users early and often. Show them prototypes. Test your assumptions. Learn what they actually need, not what you think they need.

## Why Engineers Matter More Than You Think

Engineers aren't just implementers. They're problem solvers. They understand technology better than anyone else, and they can often see solutions that others can't.

Great companies involve engineers in the discovery process. They don't just hand them requirements. They involve them in figuring out what to build and how to build it.

## The Real Cause of Product Failure

Most products fail because they're built on assumptions that haven't been validated. Companies build what they think users want, not what users actually need.

The solution is simple: validate before you build. Test your assumptions with real users. Build only what you've validated.

## How to Fix Your Product Process

Start with discovery. Figure out what to build before you build it. Test assumptions with real users. Validate that you're solving a real problem.

Then build it. But build it in a way that allows you to learn and iterate. Build the smallest thing that can deliver value, then improve it based on feedback.

Finally, measure what matters. Track whether you're solving the problem, not just whether you're building features.

## The Principle

Most products fail because they're built on assumptions that haven't been validated. The solution is to validate before you build. Test your assumptions with real users. Build only what you've validated.
