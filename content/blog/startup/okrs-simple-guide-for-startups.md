OKRs help teams pick a goal and know if they are getting closer. Think of OKRs like a treasure map: the Objective is the treasure you want, and the Key Results are the steps that tell you if you’re getting closer.

## What are OKRs?

- Objective: a short, inspiring goal you want to reach.
- Key Results: 2–5 numbers that show if you’re getting closer to the goal.

From Atlassian’s OKR guide, Objectives should be memorable and Key Results should be measurable. Keep them few so everyone remembers them. Learn more at Atlassian’s OKR guide [link](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr).

## Why use OKRs?

OKRs help you:
- Focus on what matters most
- Say “no” to distractions
- Work together as one team
- Celebrate progress, even if you aren’t perfect

Leaders like John Doerr and many startups use OKRs to aim high and learn fast. For a great intro talk, watch this video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc).

## How to write good OKRs

Simple rules (from real operators and coaches):
1. Start with one company Objective for the quarter
2. Give each team 1–2 Objectives that support the company goal
3. Write 2–5 Key Results for each Objective (all numbers)
4. Make them a stretch, but possible
5. Review progress every week; score at the end of the quarter

First Round Review explains how startups make OKRs work day-to-day: keep it simple, connect to real work, and review often. See their guide [link](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-make-okrs-actually-work-at-your-startup/). O’Reilly’s introduction shares the basics and common pitfalls [link](https://www.oreilly.com/content/introduction-to-okrs/). The Art of the OKR adds practical patterns for better goals [link](https://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr-redux/).

## Examples you can copy

Company Objective: "Delight new users"

Key Results:
- Increase week-1 activation rate from 25% to 45%
- Cut signup time from 4 minutes to 2 minutes
- Raise NPS from 20 to 35

Team Objective (Product): "Make onboarding fast and friendly"

Key Results:
- Reduce steps in onboarding from 7 to 4
- Increase trial-to-paid from 8% to 12%
- Lower support tickets about onboarding by 30%

## How to track OKRs

Use a simple weekly rhythm:
- Monday: teams share a short update (what changed for each Key Result)
- Midweek: fix blockers; adjust plans
- Friday: score KRs (0.0–1.0). 0.7 is success for stretch goals

Atlassian suggests small, measurable KRs and regular reviews. See the guide [link](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr).

## OKRs vs KPIs

- OKRs: goals to change something big this quarter (like “grow activation”).
- KPIs: the always-on numbers that tell you how the business is doing (like uptime, churn).

Think of KPIs as the dashboard of your car, and OKRs as the destination for this trip. For mapping team metrics to the org, see the KPI Org Chart idea [link](https://seekingwisdom.io/the-kpi-org-chart-1c6c22565d4b) and its write-up [link](https://medium.com/@sjmoody/the-kpi-org-chart-1c6c22565d4b).

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Too many Objectives (pick 1–3, not 10)
- Key Results that are tasks, not outcomes
- No weekly updates (you forget until the end)
- No owner (every OKR needs one DRI)
- Hidden goals (OKRs should be visible to everyone)

## Starter templates

### One-page OKR plan

- Company Objective (this quarter):
- Why it matters:
- 3–5 Key Results (numbers):
- Teams and their Objectives:
- Risks and assumptions:

### Weekly OKR update (per team)

- Objective:
- KR1: target → current → change this week
- KR2: target → current → change this week
- KR3: target → current → change this week
- Risks/blockers:
- Decisions needed:
