OKRs help you focus on what matters most. They help you say "no" to distractions. They help you work together as one team. They help you celebrate progress, even if you aren't perfect.

## What are OKRs?

- **Objective**: a short, inspiring goal you want to reach.
- **Key Results**: 2–5 numbers that show if you're getting closer to the goal.

Objectives should be memorable. Key Results should be measurable. Keep them few so everyone remembers them.

## Why use OKRs?

OKRs help you:
- Focus on what matters most
- Say "no" to distractions
- Work together as one team
- Celebrate progress, even if you aren't perfect

Leaders like John Doerr and many startups use OKRs to aim high and learn fast.

## How to write good OKRs

Simple rules:
1. Start with one company Objective for the quarter
2. Give each team 1–2 Objectives that support the company goal
3. Write 2–5 Key Results for each Objective (all numbers)
4. Make them a stretch, but possible
5. Review progress every week; score at the end of the quarter

Keep it simple. Connect to real work. Review often.

## Examples

**Company Objective**: Build a product people love

**Key Results**:
- 80% of users return within 7 days
- Net Promoter Score above 50
- 10,000 active users by end of quarter

**Team Objective**: Improve onboarding experience

**Key Results**:
- Reduce time to first value from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
- Increase completion rate from 40% to 60%
- Achieve 4.5+ star rating on onboarding

## How to track OKRs

Review progress every week. Score at the end of the quarter. Use a simple scale: 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 means you achieved the Key Result.

Don't aim for 1.0. Aim for 0.6 to 0.7. If you're hitting 1.0 consistently, your OKRs aren't ambitious enough.

## OKRs vs KPIs

OKRs are about outcomes. KPIs are about outputs.

OKRs answer: "Did we achieve what we set out to achieve?"
KPIs answer: "Are we doing the things we said we'd do?"

Use both, but don't confuse them. OKRs are for direction. KPIs are for monitoring.

## Common mistakes

- Too many OKRs. Keep it simple. Focus on what matters most.
- OKRs that aren't measurable. Key Results must be numbers.
- OKRs that aren't ambitious. If you're hitting 1.0, you're not aiming high enough.
- Set and forget. Review progress every week.

## The Principle

OKRs help you focus on what matters most. They help you work together as one team. They help you celebrate progress, even if you aren't perfect. Keep them simple, measurable, and ambitious.
