Most entrepreneurs start with an idea for a product. They fall in love with their solution and try to convince people to use it. This is backwards.

Uri Levine, who co-founded Waze (sold to Google for $1.3 billion), explains why successful entrepreneurs do the opposite: they fall in love with the problem first, then find the best solution.

## Why Most Startups Fail

Most startups fail because they start with a solution and try to find a problem for it. This is like building a hammer and then looking for nails.

The wrong way:
1. I have a great idea for an app
2. Let me build it
3. Now let me find people who want it
4. Let me convince them to use it

This approach fails because it's based on assumptions rather than evidence. You're building something without knowing if anyone actually needs it.

The right way:
1. I see a real problem people have
2. Let me understand this problem deeply
3. Let me find the best solution
4. Let me build it and test it

This approach works because it starts with market reality rather than personal assumptions. You're building something that people actually need.

## The Problem-First Mindset

Successful entrepreneurs think differently. They don't begin with ideas or solutions; they begin with curiosity about problems.

They ask "Why" before "What". They dig deep to understand the root causes. Surface-level problems often have deeper, more fundamental issues that need to be addressed.

They focus on pain, not features. Pain is a powerful motivator. When people are in pain, they're willing to pay for relief. When they're not in pain, they're not willing to pay for anything, no matter how cool or innovative it might be.

They study the problem, not the market. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of studying the market instead of studying the problem. The market exists because of the problem, not the other way around.

## How to Identify Real Problems

Not all problems are worth solving. The key is to be selective and focus on problems that have the potential to create significant value.

**Look for recurring pain.** The most valuable problems are those that occur repeatedly and cause consistent pain. These are the problems that people are most motivated to solve because they encounter them regularly.

**Find problems you understand.** The best problems to solve are those you understand deeply, either through personal experience or through close observation of others.

**Validate the problem.** Before building a solution, validate that the problem is real and that people are willing to pay to solve it. Talk to potential users, observe their behavior, and test your assumptions.

## Understanding Problem Depth

Problems have depth. Surface-level problems often have deeper, more fundamental issues that need to be addressed.

When you understand problem depth, you can identify leverage points where small changes can have big impacts. This is how breakthrough solutions are born—not from addressing symptoms, but from understanding and addressing root causes.

## Building Solutions That Work

Once you understand the problem deeply, you can build solutions that actually work.

Start small. Build the simplest solution that solves the core problem. Don't try to solve everything at once.

Test early and often. Get your solution in front of users as quickly as possible. Learn from their feedback and iterate.

Focus on the core action. Every product has a core action—the one thing users must do for the product to deliver value. Focus on making that action as easy and valuable as possible.

## The Principle

The most successful products solve real problems that people care about. When you fall in love with the problem first, you build something that people actually want, use, and pay for.
