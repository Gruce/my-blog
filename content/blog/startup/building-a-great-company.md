Building a great company is like building a great team. You need three things: a clear plan, good people who can work on their own, and a way to keep everything running smoothly.

## What "Great" Actually Means

A great company does three things well:

1. Makes things people want
2. Does it efficiently
3. Keeps doing it over time

If you can do these three things, you have a great company. If you can't, you don't.

## Strategy: Decide, Focus, and Say No

Strategy is about deciding what to do and what not to do. It's about focus. It's about saying no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones.

The key is to be clear about what you're trying to achieve and why. Then say no to everything that doesn't help you achieve it.

## Teams: Structure for Ownership and Speed

Great teams have two things:

1. **Ownership**: People own outcomes, not just tasks. They're responsible for solving problems, not just executing on requirements.

2. **Speed**: Teams can move fast because they have the autonomy to make decisions and the resources to execute.

Structure your teams for ownership and speed. Give them clear goals, the autonomy to achieve them, and the resources they need.

## Operating Cadence: Run the Machine

Great companies have a rhythm. They have regular meetings, regular reviews, regular planning. This rhythm keeps everything moving forward.

The key is to find a cadence that works for your company. It might be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. The important thing is that it's consistent and that it keeps everyone aligned.

## Hiring and Onboarding: Raise the Bar

Great companies hire great people. They don't compromise on quality. They hire people who are better than them, who can teach them, who can push them to be better.

They also onboard people well. They make sure new people understand the company, the team, and their role. They set them up for success from day one.

## Culture: Defaults That Scale

Culture is what happens when no one is looking. It's the defaults that guide behavior when there are no explicit rules.

Great companies have strong cultures. They have defaults that guide behavior in the right direction. They don't need to micromanage because the culture does it for them.

## Execution: From Ideas to Outcomes

Great companies execute well. They turn ideas into outcomes. They don't just talk about what they're going to do—they do it.

The key is to focus on outcomes, not outputs. It's not about how much you build—it's about whether what you build solves the problem.

## Customer Obsession: Continuous Discovery

Great companies are obsessed with their customers. They understand their customers deeply. They know their problems, their needs, their desires.

They also discover continuously. They don't assume they know what customers want. They test their assumptions with real customers, learn from feedback, and iterate.

## Decision-Making: Write, Debate, Commit

Great companies make good decisions. They write down their decisions, debate them thoroughly, then commit to them fully.

The key is to separate debate from commitment. Debate thoroughly before you decide. Once you decide, commit fully. Don't second-guess yourself.

## Metrics: Instruments, Not Decorations

Great companies measure what matters. They use metrics as instruments to understand what's happening, not as decorations to make presentations look good.

The key is to measure outcomes, not outputs. It's not about how much you build—it's about whether what you build solves the problem.

## The Principle

Building a great company requires three things: a clear plan, good people who can work on their own, and a way to keep everything running smoothly. Focus on outcomes, not outputs. Hire great people. Create a strong culture. Execute well. Be obsessed with your customers. Make good decisions. Measure what matters.
