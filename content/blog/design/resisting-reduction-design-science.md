Traditional design breaks problems into parts. Solve each part, solve the whole. This works for simple systems. It fails for complex ones.

Climate change, social inequality, technological disruption—these aren't puzzles with pieces. They're dynamic systems where everything connects. Optimize traffic flow and you increase pollution. Build housing and you disrupt ecosystems. The parts interact in ways you can't predict.

The Journal of Design and Science at MIT Media Lab calls this "resisting reduction." It's not about avoiding analysis. It's about keeping the whole picture in mind while working on the parts. It's about designing for new behaviors that appear naturally rather than trying to control everything.

## The Problem with Breaking Things Apart

Breaking things apart assumes the whole equals the sum of its parts. Break it down, study each piece, understand the whole. This approach built modern medicine, engineering, and technology. But complex systems have new behaviors that appear when parts interact—behaviors that don't exist in the parts alone.

A social media platform isn't just code and servers. It's a social system that shapes how people communicate, how information spreads, how societies organize. You can't understand it by studying the code alone.

Urban planning shows this clearly. Optimize traffic flow independently and you might increase pollution in residential areas. Optimize housing density independently and you might disrupt local ecosystems. The elements interact in unpredictable ways.

The challenges we face are complex, interconnected, and often unpredictable. They can't be solved by breaking them down and solving each piece independently.

## What It Means to Keep Things Whole

Keeping things whole means embracing complexity, uncertainty, and how everything connects. It means recognizing that the systems we're designing for are always changing, can adapt, and are often beyond our complete understanding.

This doesn't mean abandoning analysis. It means keeping the whole system in mind while working on specific parts. It means designing for new behaviors that appear naturally rather than just for specific outcomes. It means creating systems that can adapt and evolve.

The Journal of Design and Science explores how design and science can work together to address complex challenges. Their work focuses on where technology, society, and the environment meet—areas that are deeply connected and can't be understood separately.

Keeping things whole requires systems thinking. It requires recognizing patterns, relationships, and new behaviors that appear when parts interact. It requires designers and scientists to work together, bringing different perspectives and methods to solve complex problems.

## The Science of Complex Systems

Complex systems science studies systems that show new behaviors when parts interact, can organize themselves, and can adapt. These systems can't be understood by studying their parts alone. Their behavior comes from how the parts interact.

Ecosystems, economies, cities, the internet—these are complex systems. They're characterized by unpredictable changes, feedback loops, and the ability to adapt and evolve. They show resilience, strength, and the ability to organize themselves.

When we design for complex systems, we need to think about how our designs will interact with other systems, how they will adapt to changing conditions, and how they will contribute to or disrupt the overall system dynamics.

This is particularly relevant for technology design. Our systems are increasingly interconnected and interdependent. A social media platform affects how people communicate, how information spreads, how societies organize themselves. You can't design it in isolation.

## Designing for New Behaviors

Designing for new behaviors means creating systems that can adapt, evolve, and organize themselves rather than just doing what we tell them to do. The most interesting and valuable properties of complex systems come from how parts interact, not from the parts themselves.

When we design for new behaviors, we focus on creating conditions that make good outcomes possible rather than trying to control every aspect of the system. This means designing for flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to learn and evolve.

Open-source software development shows this. Instead of controlling every aspect of the development process, open-source projects create conditions that allow for unexpected innovation. Developers contribute in unexpected ways. New features appear from community needs. The software evolves in directions that weren't originally planned.

This approach requires design thinking that focuses on creating conditions that make things possible rather than controlling outcomes. It requires thinking about how systems change, feedback loops, and the conditions that lead to desirable new behaviors.

## The Role of Machines and AI

Machines and artificial intelligence are increasingly important parts of the complex systems we're designing. But they also present unique challenges for keeping things whole.

AI systems are often designed by breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts and optimizing each part separately. But AI systems are also complex systems themselves, with new behaviors that appear when parts interact—behaviors that can't be predicted or controlled by breaking things apart.

When AI systems interact with human systems, they create new forms of complexity that require keeping things whole to understand and design for. The MIT Media Lab has been exploring how to design AI systems that can work with rather than against the complexity of human systems.

AI systems need to be designed as part of larger systems that mix technology and people, not as isolated technical parts. This means thinking about how AI systems will interact with human systems, how they will adapt to changing conditions, and how they will contribute to or disrupt how the whole system works.

## Case Studies in Keeping Things Whole

The Internet itself is a prime example of keeping things whole. Instead of being designed as a centralized system with fixed functions, the Internet was designed as a flexible, adaptable network that could support new applications and uses that appear naturally. This design has allowed the Internet to evolve in ways that weren't originally planned, supporting everything from email to social media to the Internet of Things.

Blockchain technology represents another approach to keeping things whole. Instead of relying on centralized authorities, blockchain systems create trust through distributed agreement mechanisms that come from how network participants interact.

Open-source software communities also show how keeping things whole works. These communities create conditions for unexpected innovation by providing flexible tools and platforms that can be adapted and extended in unexpected ways.

## Practical Strategies for Complex Design

Designing for complex systems requires practical strategies based on systems thinking, emergence, and adaptation.

**Map the system.** Identify all the components, relationships, and feedback loops that make up the system. Include not just the technical components, but also the social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the system.

**Design for flexibility and adaptability.** Instead of trying to predict and control every aspect of the system, focus on creating conditions that allow the system to adapt and evolve. This might include designing for modularity, creating feedback mechanisms, or building in the ability to learn and change.

**Embrace uncertainty and complexity.** Instead of trying to eliminate uncertainty, design systems that can work with uncertainty and complexity. This might include creating multiple pathways to desired outcomes, building in backup systems and resilience, or designing systems that keep working even when parts fail.

**Focus on relationships and interactions.** Complex systems are defined by the relationships between components, not just the components themselves. Design for these relationships, not just for the components.

## Building Resilient Systems

Resilient systems can adapt, recover, and keep working when things go wrong or change. Building resilient systems requires keeping things whole because resilience comes from how system parts interact, not from the parts themselves.

**Redundancy**—having multiple pathways to achieve desired outcomes. This allows systems to continue functioning even when some components fail or are disrupted.

**Diversity**—having multiple types of components that can perform similar functions. This allows systems to adapt to changing conditions and provides multiple options for responding to challenges.

**Modularity**—having components that can be combined and recombined in different ways. This allows systems to adapt and evolve by changing how components are connected and organized.

**Feedback**—having mechanisms that allow the system to learn and adapt based on its performance and the conditions it encounters. This allows systems to improve over time and adapt to changing conditions.

## The Future of Keeping Things Whole

The future of design will increasingly require keeping things whole as the systems we're designing for become more complex, interconnected, and unpredictable.

Computational tools can help designers map how systems change, simulate different scenarios, and explore the effects of different design decisions on system behavior.

New design methods explicitly embrace complexity and uncertainty. These might include design processes that involve multiple people, step-by-step design processes that allow for learning and adaptation, and design processes that focus on creating conditions that make things possible rather than controlling outcomes.

We're seeing new fields appear that combine design thinking with scientific methods for understanding and addressing complex challenges. Design and science are no longer separate.

## Challenges and Limitations

Keeping things whole offers many benefits, but it also presents significant challenges.

Measuring and evaluating this approach is difficult. Traditional design evaluation methods focus on specific, measurable outcomes, but keeping things whole often focuses on creating conditions for new outcomes that can't be easily measured or predicted.

Managing and coordinating these design processes is complex. These processes often involve multiple people, step-by-step development, and ongoing adaptation, which can be difficult to manage and coordinate.

Resistance from organizations and institutions used to breaking things apart can make it difficult to implement keeping things whole in practice.

New skills and capabilities are needed. Keeping things whole requires skills in systems thinking, complexity science, and working with people from different fields that are not typically taught in traditional design education.

## Getting Started

Start by practicing systems thinking. Look at problems and solutions in terms of systems, relationships, and interactions rather than just individual parts. Use tools like system maps, diagrams that show cause and effect, and analysis of people involved to understand the systems you're working with.

Embrace uncertainty and complexity. Instead of trying to eliminate uncertainty, learn to work with it. Create multiple scenarios, build in flexibility, or design for adaptation rather than control.

Focus on relationships and interactions. Instead of just designing individual parts, think about how those parts will interact with other parts of the system. Design for these interactions, not just for the parts themselves.

Work with people from different fields. Keeping things whole requires bringing together different perspectives and methods. Work with people from different fields, learn their languages and methods, and find ways to combine different approaches.

The most interesting and valuable properties of complex systems come from how parts interact, not from the parts themselves. When we keep things whole, we create solutions that are more resilient, adaptive, and human-centered.
