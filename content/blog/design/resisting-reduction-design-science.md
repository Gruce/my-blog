---

Traditional design breaks problems into parts. Solve each part, solve the whole. This works for simple systems. It fails for complex ones.

Climate change, social inequality, technological disruption—these aren't puzzles with pieces. They're dynamic systems where everything connects. Optimize traffic flow and you increase pollution. Build housing and you disrupt ecosystems. The parts interact in ways you can't predict.

The MIT Media Lab calls this "resisting reduction." It's not about avoiding analysis. It's about keeping the whole picture in mind while working on the parts.

## The Problem with Breaking Things Apart

Breaking things apart assumes the whole equals the sum of its parts. But complex systems have new behaviors that appear when parts interact—behaviors that don't exist in the parts alone.

A social media platform isn't just code and servers. It's a social system that shapes how people communicate, how information spreads, how societies organize. You can't understand it by studying the code alone.

Urban planning shows this clearly. Optimize traffic flow independently and you might increase pollution in residential areas. Optimize housing density independently and you might disrupt local ecosystems. The elements interact in unpredictable ways.

## What It Means to Keep Things Whole

Keeping things whole means embracing complexity, uncertainty, and how everything connects. It means recognizing that the systems we're designing for are always changing, can adapt, and are often beyond our complete understanding.

This doesn't mean abandoning analysis. It means keeping the whole system in mind while working on specific parts. It means designing for new behaviors that appear naturally rather than just for specific outcomes.

The Journal of Design and Science explores how design and science can work together to address complex challenges. Their work focuses on where technology, society, and the environment meet—areas that are deeply connected and can't be understood separately.

## The Science of Complex Systems

Complex systems science studies systems that show new behaviors when parts interact, can organize themselves, and can adapt. These systems can't be understood by studying their parts alone. Their behavior comes from how the parts interact.

Ecosystems, economies, cities, the internet—these are complex systems. They're characterized by unpredictable changes, feedback loops, and the ability to adapt and evolve.

When we design for complex systems, we need to think about how our designs will interact with other systems, how they will adapt to changing conditions, and how they will contribute to or disrupt the overall system dynamics.

## Designing for New Behaviors

Designing for new behaviors means creating systems that can adapt, evolve, and organize themselves rather than just doing what we tell them to do. The most interesting and valuable properties of complex systems come from how parts interact, not from the parts themselves.

Open-source software development shows this. Instead of controlling every aspect of the development process, open-source projects create conditions that allow for unexpected innovation. Developers contribute in unexpected ways. New features appear from community needs. The software evolves in directions that weren't originally planned.

## The Role of Machines and AI

AI systems are often designed by breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts and optimizing each part separately. But AI systems are also complex systems themselves, with new behaviors that appear when parts interact—behaviors that can't be predicted or controlled by breaking things apart.

When AI systems interact with human systems, they create new forms of complexity that require keeping things whole to understand and design for. AI systems need to be designed as part of larger systems that mix technology and people, not as isolated technical parts.

## Practical Strategies

**Map the system.** Identify all the components, relationships, and feedback loops. Include not just the technical components, but also the social, economic, and environmental factors.

**Design for flexibility and adaptability.** Instead of trying to predict and control every aspect, focus on creating conditions that allow the system to adapt and evolve.

**Embrace uncertainty and complexity.** Instead of trying to eliminate uncertainty, design systems that can work with uncertainty and complexity.

**Focus on relationships and interactions.** Complex systems are defined by the relationships between components, not just the components themselves.

The most interesting and valuable properties of complex systems come from how parts interact, not from the parts themselves. When we keep things whole, we create solutions that are more resilient, adaptive, and human-centered.
