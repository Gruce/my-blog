# Design Science Series #3: Other Biological Futures - Designing Beyond Human-Centered Design

*This is the third article in the Design Science Series, exploring the intersection of design and science through the lens of MIT Media Lab's Journal of Design and Science (JoDS).*

What if we designed not just for humans, but for all living systems? What if we considered the needs of plants, animals, microbes, and entire ecosystems in our design decisions? The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) has been exploring these questions through their "Other Biological Futures" theme, challenging us to think beyond human-centered design and consider the needs of all living systems.

This approach isn't just about being more environmentally consciousâ€”it's about fundamentally reimagining what design can be and what it can achieve. When we design for all living systems, we create solutions that are more sustainable, resilient, and beneficial for the entire planet.

## The Limits of Human-Centered Design

Human-centered design has been the dominant approach in design practice for decades. It focuses on understanding human needs, behaviors, and experiences to create products and services that are useful, usable, and desirable for humans. This approach has led to many successful products and services, but it has also created significant problems.

The most obvious problem is environmental. Human-centered design often leads to solutions that benefit humans at the expense of other living systems. This has contributed to environmental degradation, species extinction, and climate change. When we design only for human needs, we often ignore the needs of other species and ecosystems.

Another problem is that human-centered design assumes that human needs are static and universal. But human needs are complex, contextual, and often contradictory. What benefits one human might harm another, and what benefits humans in the short term might harm humans in the long term.

A third problem is that human-centered design often leads to solutions that are unsustainable. When we design only for human needs, we often create solutions that require continuous resource extraction and waste generation. This approach is not sustainable in a world with finite resources.

The Journal of Design and Science has been exploring alternatives to human-centered design that consider the needs of all living systems. This approach, sometimes called "post-human design" or "more-than-human design," challenges us to think beyond human needs and consider the needs of all living systems.

## What Are Other Biological Futures?

Other biological futures are alternative ways of organizing life on Earth that go beyond human-centered approaches. These futures consider the needs of all living systems, not just humans, and seek to create conditions where all life can thrive.

One example is the concept of "rewilding," which involves restoring ecosystems to their natural state and allowing natural processes to operate without human intervention. This approach recognizes that many ecosystems are more resilient and productive when they are allowed to function naturally, without human management.

Another example is the concept of "biomimicry," which involves learning from and mimicking natural systems to solve human problems. This approach recognizes that natural systems have evolved over millions of years to be efficient, sustainable, and resilient, and that we can learn from these systems to create better human solutions.

A third example is the concept of "synthetic biology," which involves engineering biological systems to perform specific functions. This approach recognizes that we can design biological systems to address human needs while also supporting the health and function of natural ecosystems.

The key insight from these approaches is that we don't have to choose between human needs and the needs of other living systems. We can design solutions that benefit all living systems, creating conditions where humans and other species can thrive together.

## Designing for Non-Human Species

Designing for non-human species requires us to think about the needs and behaviors of other living systems. This is challenging because we can't directly communicate with most other species, and we often don't understand their needs and behaviors.

One approach is to use scientific research to understand the needs and behaviors of other species. This might include studying animal behavior, plant physiology, or microbial ecology to understand how these systems function and what they need to thrive.

Another approach is to use technology to monitor and understand the needs of other species. This might include using sensors to monitor environmental conditions, or using artificial intelligence to analyze patterns in animal behavior or plant growth.

A third approach is to involve experts from other disciplines in the design process. This might include working with biologists, ecologists, or other scientists who understand the needs and behaviors of other species.

The key insight is that designing for other species requires us to expand our understanding of what design can be and what it can achieve. Instead of designing only for human needs, we can design for the needs of all living systems.

## Ecosystem-Centered Design

Ecosystem-centered design focuses on the health and function of entire ecosystems rather than individual species or components. This approach recognizes that ecosystems are complex, interconnected systems where the health of the whole depends on the health of all its parts.

One example is the design of urban ecosystems. Instead of designing cities as collections of separate buildings and infrastructure, we can design them as integrated ecosystems where buildings, infrastructure, and natural systems work together to support the health and function of the entire ecosystem.

Another example is the design of agricultural systems. Instead of designing farms as industrial systems that extract resources and generate waste, we can design them as ecosystems that support the health and function of soil, water, and biodiversity.

A third example is the design of energy systems. Instead of designing energy systems that rely on fossil fuels and generate pollution, we can design them as ecosystems that support the health and function of natural systems while providing clean energy for human needs.

The key insight is that ecosystem-centered design creates solutions that benefit all living systems, not just humans. This approach leads to more sustainable, resilient, and beneficial solutions for the entire planet.

## The Role of Technology in Biological Futures

Technology can play an important role in creating other biological futures, but it needs to be designed and used in ways that support rather than harm natural systems. This requires a fundamental shift in how we think about technology and its role in society.

One approach is to use technology to monitor and understand natural systems. This might include using sensors to monitor environmental conditions, or using artificial intelligence to analyze patterns in natural systems. This information can help us understand how natural systems function and what they need to thrive.

Another approach is to use technology to restore and enhance natural systems. This might include using biotechnology to restore degraded ecosystems, or using renewable energy technologies to reduce our impact on natural systems.

A third approach is to use technology to create new forms of life that can support natural systems. This might include using synthetic biology to create organisms that can clean up pollution, or using biotechnology to create organisms that can support biodiversity.

The key insight is that technology can be a tool for supporting rather than harming natural systems. When we design technology with the needs of all living systems in mind, we can create solutions that benefit the entire planet.

## Case Studies in Post-Human Design

Several organizations and projects have successfully applied post-human design principles to create more sustainable and beneficial solutions. These case studies provide valuable insights into how to apply these principles in practice.

The Biomimicry Institute has been exploring how biological principles can inform design thinking. Their work includes the development of design tools and methods that help designers apply biological principles to human systems, and the creation of databases of biological solutions that can inform human design.

The Living Building Challenge is a certification program that applies post-human design principles to building design. Instead of designing buildings as isolated structures, the program encourages the design of buildings as parts of larger ecosystems where buildings, infrastructure, and natural systems work together for mutual benefit.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has been promoting the concept of the circular economy, which applies post-human design principles to economic systems. Instead of designing economic systems as linear processes where resources are extracted, used, and discarded, the circular economy designs economic systems as circular processes where resources are continuously reused and recycled.

## The Ethics of Non-Human Design

Designing for non-human species raises important ethical questions about our relationship with other living systems. These questions need to be carefully considered if we're to successfully apply post-human design principles in practice.

One ethical question is about consent. How do we know what other species want or need? Can we make decisions about their welfare without their consent? These questions are particularly relevant when we're designing systems that will directly affect other species.

Another ethical question is about responsibility. If we design systems that affect other species, what is our responsibility to ensure their welfare? How do we balance human needs with the needs of other species?

A third ethical question is about power. Who gets to decide what other species need? How do we ensure that decisions about other species are made in their best interests rather than in the interests of humans?

These ethical questions don't have easy answers, but they need to be addressed if we're to successfully apply post-human design principles in practice. The key is to approach these questions with humility, respect, and a commitment to the welfare of all living systems.

## Tools and Methods for Biological Design

Designing for biological systems requires new tools and methods that can help us understand and work with the complexity of natural systems. These tools and methods are still being developed, but they offer promising approaches for post-human design.

One tool is systems thinking, which helps us understand the complex interactions between different components of natural systems. This approach recognizes that natural systems are more than the sum of their parts, and that their behavior emerges from the interactions between components.

Another tool is biomimicry, which involves learning from and mimicking natural systems to solve human problems. This approach recognizes that natural systems have evolved over millions of years to be efficient, sustainable, and resilient, and that we can learn from these systems to create better human solutions.

A third tool is synthetic biology, which involves engineering biological systems to perform specific functions. This approach recognizes that we can design biological systems to address human needs while also supporting the health and function of natural ecosystems.

The key insight is that designing for biological systems requires us to expand our toolkit and develop new ways of thinking about design. Instead of using traditional design methods that focus on human needs, we need to develop methods that can work with the complexity of natural systems.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While post-human design offers many benefits, it also presents significant challenges and opportunities. These challenges need to be understood and addressed if we're to successfully apply these approaches in practice.

One major challenge is the complexity of designing for multiple species simultaneously. Natural systems are complex, interconnected, and often unpredictable, and designing for all species simultaneously can be complex and challenging.

Another challenge is the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Post-human design requires bringing together knowledge from biology, design, engineering, and other disciplines. This requires new ways of working and collaborating across disciplines.

A third challenge is the resistance to change from existing systems and institutions. Post-human design often requires fundamental changes to how systems are organized and operated, which can meet resistance from existing stakeholders.

A fourth challenge is the need for new metrics and evaluation methods. Traditional design evaluation methods focus on human needs, but post-human design focuses on the needs of all living systems, which can be difficult to measure and evaluate.

## The Future of Biological Design

The future of design will increasingly require post-human thinking as the challenges we face become more complex, interconnected, and systemic. This will require new tools, methods, and ways of thinking about design.

One emerging trend is the use of biological principles to inform design thinking. This includes the development of design methods that explicitly incorporate biological principles, the use of biological models to understand and design complex systems, and the integration of biological knowledge into design education and practice.

Another trend is the development of new tools and technologies that support post-human design. This might include computational tools for modeling complex biological systems, new materials and technologies that support biological systems, or new methods for measuring and evaluating the health of natural systems.

A third trend is the integration of post-human thinking into mainstream design practice. This includes the development of new design standards and guidelines that incorporate post-human principles, the creation of new design education programs that teach post-human thinking, and the development of new business models that support post-human design.

## Getting Started with Post-Human Design

Getting started with post-human design requires a shift in mindset and approach. Here are some practical steps for beginning to apply these principles in your own work.

Start by learning about natural systems. This means studying biology, ecology, and other sciences to understand how natural systems function. Use tools like field guides, scientific papers, and online resources to learn about the needs and behaviors of different species.

Next, practice systems thinking. This means looking at problems and solutions in terms of systems, relationships, and interactions rather than just individual components. Use tools like system maps, causal loop diagrams, and stakeholder analysis to understand the systems you're working with.

Then, focus on relationships and interactions. Instead of just designing individual components, think about how those components will interact with other parts of the system. Design for these interactions, not just for the components themselves.

Finally, practice interdisciplinary collaboration. Post-human design requires bringing together different perspectives and methodologies. Work with people from different disciplines, learn their languages and methods, and find ways to integrate different approaches.

## Implications for Design Practice

Post-human design has important implications for how we practice design. These implications need to be understood and addressed if we're to successfully apply these approaches in practice.

One implication is the need for new design education. Traditional design education focuses on human needs and human-centered methods, but post-human design requires education that covers biological systems, ecological principles, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Another implication is the need for new design tools and methods. Traditional design tools and methods are designed for human-centered design, but post-human design requires tools and methods that can work with the complexity of natural systems.

A third implication is the need for new design standards and guidelines. Traditional design standards focus on human needs and human-centered outcomes, but post-human design requires standards that consider the needs of all living systems.

A fourth implication is the need for new business models. Traditional business models focus on human needs and human-centered value creation, but post-human design requires business models that consider the needs of all living systems.

## The Bottom Line

Other biological futures represent a fundamental shift in how we think about design and its role in society. Instead of designing only for human needs, we can design for the needs of all living systems, creating solutions that are more sustainable, resilient, and beneficial for the entire planet.

The Journal of Design and Science has been at the forefront of exploring these approaches, providing a platform for researchers and practitioners to share insights and experiences. Their work demonstrates that post-human design can lead to innovative solutions that work with rather than against natural systems.

The key is to start small, practice systems thinking, and gradually build the skills and capabilities needed for post-human design. With practice and persistence, these approaches can become powerful tools for addressing the complex challenges we face.
