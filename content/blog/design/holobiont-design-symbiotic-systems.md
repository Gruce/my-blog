# Holobiont Design: Creating Symbiotic Systems Across Scales

The concept of the holobiont—a host organism and its associated microbial communities functioning as a single unit—has revolutionized our understanding of biology. But what if we applied this same thinking to design? What if we designed systems that thrive through mutual benefit and interdependence rather than competition and isolation?

The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) has been exploring how biological concepts like holobionts can inform design thinking, particularly in the context of creating more sustainable and resilient systems. This approach isn't just metaphorical—it's a practical framework for designing systems that work with rather than against the natural world.

## What is a Holobiont?

A holobiont is a biological unit consisting of a host organism and its associated microbial communities. The term was first coined by Lynn Margulis in the 1990s to describe the intimate relationships between organisms and their microbiomes. But the concept goes deeper than just host-microbe relationships—it represents a fundamental shift in how we understand life itself.

In a holobiont, the host and its microbial communities are not separate entities but rather a single, integrated system. The host provides a stable environment and resources, while the microbes provide essential functions like digestion, immunity, and nutrient cycling. Neither can survive without the other, and together they form a more resilient and adaptable system than either could alone.

This concept has profound implications for how we think about systems in general. Instead of viewing systems as collections of independent components, we can view them as integrated wholes where each component contributes to the overall health and function of the system.

The human body is perhaps the most familiar example of a holobiont. We are not just human cells—we are a complex ecosystem of human cells, bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that work together to maintain our health and well-being. These microbial communities are essential for everything from digestion to immune function to mental health.

## The Biology of Symbiosis

Symbiosis is the foundation of holobiont relationships. In biological systems, symbiosis refers to long-term interactions between different species that can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral to the participants. The most interesting symbiotic relationships are those that are mutually beneficial—where both partners gain from the interaction.

These mutually beneficial relationships are not just nice-to-have features of biological systems—they are essential for the survival and success of most organisms. Plants depend on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, coral reefs depend on coral-algae symbiosis for energy production, and humans depend on gut bacteria for digestion and immune function.

The key insight from biological symbiosis is that cooperation and mutual benefit are often more successful strategies than competition and exploitation. Systems that are built on mutual benefit tend to be more stable, resilient, and adaptable than systems built on competition.

This insight has important implications for how we design human systems. Instead of designing systems that maximize individual benefit at the expense of others, we can design systems that create mutual benefit for all participants. This approach leads to more stable, resilient, and sustainable systems.

## Applying Holobiont Thinking to Design

Holobiont thinking can be applied to design in several ways. The most direct application is to design systems that mimic the symbiotic relationships found in biological systems. This means creating systems where different components work together for mutual benefit rather than competing for resources.

One example is the design of urban ecosystems. Instead of designing cities as collections of separate buildings and infrastructure, we can design them as integrated systems where buildings, infrastructure, and natural systems work together for mutual benefit. This might include green roofs that provide habitat for wildlife while reducing building energy costs, or urban agriculture systems that provide food while improving air quality.

Another example is the design of digital ecosystems. Instead of designing apps and platforms as isolated systems, we can design them as parts of larger ecosystems where different platforms and services work together for mutual benefit. This might include open APIs that allow different services to integrate, or shared data standards that allow different systems to communicate and collaborate.

The key principle is to design for mutual benefit rather than individual optimization. This means thinking about how different components of a system can work together to create value for all participants, rather than just maximizing value for individual components.

## Symbiotic Systems in Technology

Technology systems can be designed using holobiont principles to create more resilient and adaptable systems. Instead of designing technology as isolated components, we can design it as integrated systems where different technologies work together for mutual benefit.

One example is the Internet of Things (IoT). Instead of designing IoT devices as isolated sensors and actuators, we can design them as parts of larger ecosystems where devices work together to create intelligent, adaptive systems. This might include smart buildings where sensors, actuators, and control systems work together to optimize energy use and comfort.

Another example is artificial intelligence systems. Instead of designing AI as isolated algorithms, we can design it as part of larger ecosystems where AI systems work together with human systems to create more intelligent and adaptive solutions. This might include collaborative AI systems where humans and AI work together to solve complex problems.

The key insight is that technology systems are most effective when they are designed as parts of larger ecosystems rather than as isolated components. This means thinking about how different technologies can work together to create value, rather than just optimizing individual technologies.

## Designing for Mutual Benefit

Designing for mutual benefit requires a fundamental shift in how we think about value creation. Instead of thinking about value as something that is extracted from one party and transferred to another, we can think about value as something that is created through the interaction between different parties.

This shift in thinking has important implications for how we design business models, products, and services. Instead of designing for zero-sum interactions where one party's gain is another party's loss, we can design for positive-sum interactions where all parties benefit from the interaction.

One example is the sharing economy. Instead of designing systems where individuals compete for resources, we can design systems where individuals share resources for mutual benefit. This might include car-sharing services where multiple people benefit from access to transportation, or co-working spaces where multiple people benefit from shared office resources.

Another example is open-source software development. Instead of designing software as proprietary systems where value is extracted from users, we can design software as open systems where value is created through collaboration and sharing. This approach has led to some of the most successful and widely-used software systems in the world.

## Cross-Scale Interactions

Holobiont systems operate across multiple scales, from the molecular level to the ecosystem level. This multi-scale operation is essential for the resilience and adaptability of these systems. When we design systems using holobiont principles, we need to consider how they will operate across different scales.

At the local scale, holobiont systems might include individual devices or components that work together for mutual benefit. At the regional scale, they might include networks of devices or systems that work together to create larger-scale benefits. At the global scale, they might include international networks of systems that work together to address global challenges.

This multi-scale approach is particularly important for addressing complex challenges like climate change, where solutions need to work at multiple scales simultaneously. Local solutions need to contribute to global goals, while global frameworks need to support local implementation.

One example is renewable energy systems. At the local scale, individual solar panels or wind turbines provide energy for individual buildings or communities. At the regional scale, these systems can be connected to create larger-scale energy networks. At the global scale, these networks can work together to create global networks of clean energy systems.

## Case Studies in Holobiont Design

Several organizations and projects have successfully applied holobiont design principles to create more sustainable and resilient systems. These case studies provide valuable insights into how to apply these principles in practice.

The Living Building Challenge is a certification program that applies holobiont principles to building design. Instead of designing buildings as isolated structures, the program encourages the design of buildings as parts of larger ecosystems where buildings, infrastructure, and natural systems work together for mutual benefit.

The Biomimicry Institute has been exploring how biological principles can inform design thinking. Their work includes the development of design tools and methods that help designers apply biological principles to human systems.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has been promoting the concept of the circular economy, which applies holobiont principles to economic systems. Instead of designing economic systems as linear processes where resources are extracted, used, and discarded, the circular economy designs economic systems as circular processes where resources are continuously reused and recycled.

## The Role of Microbiomes in Design

Microbiomes are the microbial communities that live in and on organisms and play essential roles in their health and function. In holobiont design, microbiomes can serve as models for how to design microbial communities that support human health and well-being.

One example is the design of indoor environments. Instead of designing indoor environments as sterile spaces, we can design them as environments that support healthy microbial communities. This might include the use of natural materials that support beneficial microbes, or the design of ventilation systems that promote healthy air quality.

Another example is the design of food systems. Instead of designing food systems that rely on industrial agriculture and processing, we can design food systems that support healthy soil microbiomes and human gut microbiomes. This might include the use of regenerative agriculture practices that support soil health, or the design of food processing methods that preserve beneficial microbes.

The key insight is that human health and well-being depend on healthy microbial communities. When we design systems that support these communities, we create systems that support human health and well-being.

## Building Resilient Ecosystems

Resilient ecosystems are those that can adapt, recover, and continue to function in the face of disruption and change. Building resilient ecosystems requires holobiont thinking because resilience emerges from the interactions between different components of the ecosystem.

One key principle of resilient ecosystems is diversity. Diverse ecosystems are more resilient because they have multiple pathways for responding to challenges and multiple options for adapting to change. This diversity can be at the species level, the functional level, or the spatial level.

Another key principle is redundancy. Resilient ecosystems have multiple components that can perform similar functions, so if one component fails, others can take over. This redundancy allows ecosystems to continue functioning even when some components are disrupted.

A third key principle is modularity. Resilient ecosystems have components that can be combined and recombined in different ways, allowing them to adapt to changing conditions. This modularity allows ecosystems to evolve and change in response to new challenges.

The fourth key principle is feedback. Resilient ecosystems have mechanisms that allow them to learn and adapt based on their performance and the conditions they encounter. This feedback allows ecosystems to improve over time and adapt to changing conditions.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While holobiont design offers many benefits, it also presents significant challenges and opportunities. These challenges need to be understood and addressed if we're to successfully apply these approaches in practice.

One major challenge is the complexity of designing for multiple scales simultaneously. Holobiont systems operate across multiple scales, and designing for all scales simultaneously can be complex and challenging. This requires new tools, methods, and ways of thinking about design.

Another challenge is the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Holobiont design requires bringing together knowledge from biology, design, engineering, and other disciplines. This requires new ways of working and collaborating across disciplines.

A third challenge is the resistance to change from existing systems and institutions. Holobiont design often requires fundamental changes to how systems are organized and operated, which can meet resistance from existing stakeholders.

A fourth challenge is the need for new metrics and evaluation methods. Traditional design evaluation methods focus on individual components, but holobiont design focuses on system-level outcomes that can be difficult to measure and evaluate.

## Practical Applications

Despite these challenges, holobiont design offers many practical applications for addressing complex challenges. These applications demonstrate the potential of this approach for creating more sustainable and resilient systems.

One application is urban design. Cities can be designed as holobiont systems where buildings, infrastructure, and natural systems work together for mutual benefit. This might include the design of green infrastructure that provides multiple benefits, or the creation of urban ecosystems that support biodiversity and human well-being.

Another application is agriculture. Agricultural systems can be designed as holobiont systems where crops, soil, and microbial communities work together for mutual benefit. This might include the use of regenerative agriculture practices that support soil health, or the design of farming systems that support biodiversity and ecosystem services.

A third application is technology design. Technology systems can be designed as holobiont systems where different technologies work together for mutual benefit. This might include the design of smart cities where different technologies work together to create intelligent, adaptive systems, or the creation of digital ecosystems where different platforms and services work together for mutual benefit.

## The Future of Holobiont Design

The future of design will increasingly require holobiont thinking as the challenges we face become more complex, interconnected, and systemic. This will require new tools, methods, and ways of thinking about design.

One emerging trend is the use of biological principles to inform design thinking. This includes the development of design methods that explicitly incorporate biological principles, the use of biological models to understand and design complex systems, and the integration of biological knowledge into design education and practice.

Another trend is the development of new tools and technologies that support holobiont design. This might include computational tools for modeling complex systems, new materials and technologies that support symbiotic relationships, or new methods for measuring and evaluating system-level outcomes.

A third trend is the integration of holobiont thinking into mainstream design practice. This includes the development of new design standards and guidelines that incorporate holobiont principles, the creation of new design education programs that teach holobiont thinking, and the development of new business models that support holobiont design.

## The Bottom Line

Holobiont design represents a fundamental shift in how we think about systems and relationships. Instead of viewing systems as collections of independent components, we can view them as integrated wholes where each component contributes to the overall health and function of the system.

This approach has important implications for how we design human systems. Instead of designing systems that maximize individual benefit at the expense of others, we can design systems that create mutual benefit for all participants. This leads to more stable, resilient, and sustainable systems.

The Journal of Design and Science has been at the forefront of exploring these approaches, providing a platform for researchers and practitioners to share insights and experiences. Their work demonstrates that holobiont thinking can lead to innovative solutions that work with rather than against the natural world.

The key is to start small, practice systems thinking, and gradually build the skills and capabilities needed for holobiont design. With practice and persistence, these approaches can become powerful tools for addressing the complex challenges we face.
