Human-centered design has been the dominant approach for decades. Understand human needs, behaviors, and experiences. Create products and services that are useful, usable, and desirable for humans. This approach has led to many successful products. But it has also created significant problems.

The most obvious problem is environmental. Human-centered design often benefits humans at the expense of other living systems. This has contributed to environmental degradation, species extinction, and climate change.

Another problem: human-centered design assumes human needs are static and universal. But human needs are complex, contextual, and often contradictory.

A third problem: human-centered design often leads to solutions that are unsustainable. When we design only for human needs, we often create solutions that require continuous resource extraction and waste generation.

## What Are Other Biological Futures?

Other biological futures are alternative ways of organizing life on Earth that go beyond human-centered approaches. These futures consider the needs of all living systems, not just humans, and seek to create conditions where all life can thrive.

**Rewilding** is one example. This involves restoring ecosystems to their natural state and allowing natural processes to operate without human intervention.

**Biomimicry** is another example. This involves learning from and mimicking natural systems to solve human problems.

**Synthetic biology** is a third example. This involves engineering biological systems to perform specific functions.

The key insight: we don't have to choose between human needs and the needs of other living systems. We can design solutions that benefit all living systems.

## Designing for Non-Human Species

Designing for non-human species requires us to think about the needs and behaviors of other living systems. This is challenging because we can't directly communicate with most other species.

One approach is to use scientific research to understand the needs and behaviors of other species. Another approach is to use technology to monitor and understand the needs of other species. A third approach is to involve experts from other disciplines in the design process.

The key insight: designing for other species requires us to expand our understanding of what design can be and what it can achieve.

## Ecosystem-Centered Design

Ecosystem-centered design focuses on the health and function of entire ecosystems rather than individual species or components. This approach recognizes that ecosystems are complex, interconnected systems where the health of the whole depends on the health of all its parts.

**Urban ecosystems** provide one example. Instead of designing cities as collections of separate buildings and infrastructure, we can design them as integrated ecosystems.

**Agricultural systems** provide another example. Instead of designing farms as industrial systems that extract resources and generate waste, we can design them as ecosystems that support the health and function of soil, water, and biodiversity.

**Energy systems** provide a third example. Instead of designing energy systems that rely on fossil fuels and generate pollution, we can design them as ecosystems that support the health and function of natural systems while providing clean energy for human needs.

The key insight: ecosystem-centered design creates solutions that benefit all living systems, not just humans.

## The Role of Technology

Technology can play an important role in creating other biological futures, but it needs to be designed and used in ways that support rather than harm natural systems.

One approach is to use technology to monitor and understand natural systems. Another approach is to use technology to restore and enhance natural systems. A third approach is to use technology to create new forms of life that can support natural systems.

The key insight: technology can be a tool for supporting rather than harming natural systems. When we design technology with the needs of all living systems in mind, we can create solutions that benefit the entire planet.

## The Principle

The most sustainable and beneficial solutions are those that consider the needs of all living systems, not just humans. When we design for all living systems, we create solutions that are more sustainable, resilient, and beneficial for the entire planet.
