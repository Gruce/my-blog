# Design Science Series #4: Unreal Design - Creating Virtual Realities That Matter

*This is the fourth article in the Design Science Series, exploring the intersection of design and science through the lens of MIT Media Lab's Journal of Design and Science (JoDS).*

The boundary between the real and the virtual is becoming increasingly blurred. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and other immersive technologies are creating new possibilities for design that go beyond traditional physical constraints. The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) has been exploring these "unreal" possibilities through their theme of creating virtual realities that have real-world impact and meaning.

This isn't just about creating entertainment or escapism—it's about using virtual technologies to address real-world challenges, create meaningful experiences, and expand the possibilities of what design can achieve. When we design for virtual realities, we're not just creating digital experiences; we're creating new ways of being, thinking, and interacting with the world.

## The Nature of Virtual Reality

Virtual reality is more than just a technology—it's a new medium for human experience and expression. Unlike traditional media, virtual reality creates immersive, interactive environments that can be experienced from the inside out. This creates new possibilities for design that go beyond traditional physical constraints.

The key characteristic of virtual reality is presence—the feeling of being physically present in a virtual environment. This presence is what makes virtual reality different from other media, and it's what creates the potential for new forms of design and interaction.

Presence in virtual reality is created through a combination of visual, auditory, and sometimes haptic feedback that creates a convincing illusion of being in a different place. This illusion can be so convincing that people respond to virtual experiences as if they were real, creating new possibilities for design and interaction.

The Journal of Design and Science has been exploring how virtual reality can be used to create meaningful experiences that have real-world impact. This includes research on how virtual experiences can be used for education, therapy, social interaction, and other applications that go beyond entertainment.

## Designing for Immersive Experiences

Designing for virtual reality requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional design. Instead of designing for screens and interfaces, we're designing for immersive, three-dimensional environments that people can move through and interact with.

One key principle of virtual reality design is spatial design. Virtual environments are three-dimensional spaces that people can navigate and explore. This requires thinking about space, scale, movement, and navigation in ways that are different from traditional interface design.

Another key principle is interaction design. Virtual reality allows for new forms of interaction that go beyond clicking and typing. People can use their hands, body, and voice to interact with virtual environments in natural and intuitive ways.

A third key principle is narrative design. Virtual reality can be used to tell stories and create experiences that are more immersive and engaging than traditional media. This requires thinking about storytelling, pacing, and user agency in new ways.

The key insight is that virtual reality design is about creating experiences, not just interfaces. Instead of designing for efficiency and usability, we're designing for presence, engagement, and meaning.

## The Psychology of Virtual Spaces

Virtual reality has unique psychological effects that designers need to understand and work with. These effects can be both positive and negative, and they need to be carefully considered in the design process.

One psychological effect is the sense of presence, which can be so convincing that people respond to virtual experiences as if they were real. This can be used to create powerful educational, therapeutic, and social experiences, but it can also be used to manipulate or deceive people.

Another psychological effect is the sense of embodiment, which refers to the feeling of having a body in virtual space. This can be used to create experiences that help people understand different perspectives or identities, but it can also create confusion or discomfort.

A third psychological effect is the sense of agency, which refers to the feeling of being able to act and have an effect on the virtual environment. This can be used to create engaging and empowering experiences, but it can also create frustration if the virtual environment doesn't respond as expected.

The key insight is that virtual reality design needs to consider the psychological effects of virtual experiences on users. Instead of just focusing on technical functionality, we need to think about how virtual experiences affect people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

## Virtual Reality as a Design Tool

Virtual reality can be used as a design tool to create and test solutions in ways that aren't possible with traditional methods. This includes using virtual reality for prototyping, user testing, and collaborative design.

One application is virtual prototyping, which allows designers to create and test three-dimensional designs in virtual space before building physical prototypes. This can save time and money while allowing for more iterative design processes.

Another application is virtual user testing, which allows designers to test designs with users in controlled virtual environments. This can provide insights into user behavior and preferences that aren't possible with traditional testing methods.

A third application is virtual collaborative design, which allows multiple designers to work together in shared virtual spaces. This can enable new forms of collaboration and creativity that aren't possible with traditional tools.

The key insight is that virtual reality can be used to enhance and extend traditional design processes. Instead of replacing traditional methods, virtual reality can complement them and create new possibilities for design and collaboration.

## Case Studies in Virtual Design

Several organizations and projects have successfully applied virtual reality design principles to create meaningful experiences and solutions. These case studies provide valuable insights into how to apply these principles in practice.

The Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford University has been exploring how virtual reality can be used for education, therapy, and social interaction. Their work includes research on how virtual experiences can be used to teach empathy, reduce prejudice, and improve social skills.

The MIT Media Lab has been exploring how virtual reality can be used for creative expression and artistic exploration. Their work includes research on how virtual environments can be used for music, dance, and other forms of artistic expression.

The University of California, San Francisco has been exploring how virtual reality can be used for medical training and patient care. Their work includes research on how virtual experiences can be used to train surgeons, treat phobias, and improve patient outcomes.

The key insight from these case studies is that virtual reality design can be used to create experiences that have real-world impact and meaning. Instead of just creating entertainment or escapism, virtual reality can be used to address real-world challenges and create positive change.

## The Ethics of Virtual Design

Virtual reality design raises important ethical questions about the nature of reality, the power of technology, and the responsibility of designers. These questions need to be carefully considered if we're to successfully apply virtual reality design principles in practice.

One ethical question is about the nature of reality. What is the difference between virtual and real experiences? Can virtual experiences be as meaningful as real experiences? These questions are particularly relevant when we're designing experiences that are meant to have real-world impact.

Another ethical question is about the power of technology. Virtual reality can be used to create experiences that are so convincing that people respond to them as if they were real. This creates the potential for manipulation and deception, which raises questions about the responsibility of designers.

A third ethical question is about the impact on society. Virtual reality can be used to create experiences that are more engaging and immersive than real life, which could lead to people preferring virtual experiences over real ones. This raises questions about the impact on social relationships, mental health, and society as a whole.

These ethical questions don't have easy answers, but they need to be addressed if we're to successfully apply virtual reality design principles in practice. The key is to approach these questions with humility, respect, and a commitment to the welfare of users and society.

## Tools and Methods for Virtual Design

Designing for virtual reality requires new tools and methods that can help us create immersive, interactive experiences. These tools and methods are still being developed, but they offer promising approaches for virtual reality design.

One tool is 3D modeling and animation software, which allows designers to create three-dimensional models and animations for virtual environments. This includes software like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max, which are commonly used for creating virtual reality content.

Another tool is game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, which provide platforms for creating interactive virtual experiences. These engines include tools for physics simulation, lighting, and interaction design that are essential for virtual reality development.

A third tool is virtual reality development kits and software development kits (SDKs) that provide tools for creating virtual reality applications. This includes tools like the Oculus SDK, the SteamVR SDK, and the WebXR API for creating web-based virtual reality experiences.

The key insight is that designing for virtual reality requires us to expand our toolkit and develop new ways of thinking about design. Instead of using traditional design tools that focus on screens and interfaces, we need to develop tools that can work with immersive, three-dimensional environments.

## The Future of Virtual Design

The future of design will increasingly require virtual reality thinking as the technology becomes more accessible and powerful. This will require new tools, methods, and ways of thinking about design.

One emerging trend is the use of artificial intelligence to create more intelligent and adaptive virtual environments. This includes the use of machine learning to create virtual characters that can respond to users in natural and engaging ways, or the use of AI to create virtual environments that can adapt to user behavior and preferences.

Another trend is the development of more immersive and realistic virtual experiences. This includes the use of haptic feedback to create tactile experiences, or the use of eye tracking and other sensors to create more natural and intuitive interactions.

A third trend is the integration of virtual reality with other technologies like augmented reality, mixed reality, and the Internet of Things. This will create new possibilities for hybrid experiences that combine virtual and real elements in new and interesting ways.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While virtual reality design offers many benefits, it also presents significant challenges and opportunities. These challenges need to be understood and addressed if we're to successfully apply these approaches in practice.

One major challenge is the technical complexity of creating virtual reality experiences. Virtual reality development requires skills in 3D modeling, programming, and user experience design that are not typically taught in traditional design education.

Another challenge is the need for new design methods and processes. Virtual reality design requires thinking about space, movement, and interaction in ways that are different from traditional design, which requires new methods and processes.

A third challenge is the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Virtual reality design requires bringing together knowledge from design, technology, psychology, and other disciplines, which requires new ways of working and collaborating.

A fourth challenge is the need for new evaluation methods. Traditional design evaluation methods focus on usability and efficiency, but virtual reality design focuses on presence, engagement, and meaning, which can be difficult to measure and evaluate.

## Getting Started with Virtual Design

Getting started with virtual reality design requires a shift in mindset and approach. Here are some practical steps for beginning to apply these principles in your own work.

Start by learning about virtual reality technology and its capabilities. This means understanding the hardware and software that makes virtual reality possible, and the technical constraints and opportunities that come with it.

Next, practice creating virtual experiences. This means using tools like Unity or Unreal Engine to create simple virtual environments and interactions. Start with basic projects and gradually build up to more complex experiences.

Then, focus on user experience design for virtual reality. This means thinking about how users will navigate and interact with virtual environments, and how to create experiences that are engaging and meaningful.

Finally, practice interdisciplinary collaboration. Virtual reality design requires bringing together different perspectives and methodologies. Work with people from different disciplines, learn their languages and methods, and find ways to integrate different approaches.

## Implications for Design Practice

Virtual reality design has important implications for how we practice design. These implications need to be understood and addressed if we're to successfully apply these approaches in practice.

One implication is the need for new design education. Traditional design education focuses on screens and interfaces, but virtual reality design requires education that covers 3D modeling, spatial design, and immersive experience design.

Another implication is the need for new design tools and methods. Traditional design tools are designed for screens and interfaces, but virtual reality design requires tools that can work with immersive, three-dimensional environments.

A third implication is the need for new design standards and guidelines. Traditional design standards focus on usability and efficiency, but virtual reality design requires standards that consider presence, engagement, and meaning.

A fourth implication is the need for new business models. Traditional business models focus on software and services, but virtual reality design requires business models that consider hardware, content, and experiences.

## The Impact of Virtual Design

Virtual reality design has the potential to create significant impact on society, culture, and human experience. This impact can be both positive and negative, and it needs to be carefully considered in the design process.

One positive impact is the potential for virtual reality to create new forms of education and learning. Virtual experiences can be used to teach complex concepts, provide hands-on training, and create immersive educational experiences that are more engaging than traditional methods.

Another positive impact is the potential for virtual reality to create new forms of therapy and healing. Virtual experiences can be used to treat phobias, PTSD, and other mental health conditions in ways that aren't possible with traditional methods.

A third positive impact is the potential for virtual reality to create new forms of social interaction and community. Virtual environments can be used to bring people together across distances, create shared experiences, and build communities around common interests.

However, there are also potential negative impacts that need to be considered. Virtual reality could be used to create addictive experiences that distract from real life, or to create experiences that are so convincing that they blur the line between virtual and real.

## The Bottom Line

Virtual reality design represents a fundamental shift in how we think about design and its role in society. Instead of designing for screens and interfaces, we're designing for immersive, three-dimensional environments that people can experience from the inside out.

This approach has important implications for how we practice design, how we think about technology, and how we understand human experience. Instead of just creating tools and interfaces, we're creating new ways of being, thinking, and interacting with the world.

The Journal of Design and Science has been at the forefront of exploring these approaches, providing a platform for researchers and practitioners to share insights and experiences. Their work demonstrates that virtual reality design can lead to innovative solutions that have real-world impact and meaning.

The key is to start small, practice creating virtual experiences, and gradually build the skills and capabilities needed for virtual reality design. With practice and persistence, these approaches can become powerful tools for addressing the complex challenges we face.
