Typography is more than choosing fonts. It's about creating visual hierarchies that guide the eye and help readers focus on what matters most.

The best typography doesn't just look good—it creates a clear path for the eye to follow, establishes visual priorities, and helps readers understand the relative importance of different information.

## How People Read

The human eye doesn't read text word-by-word. It scans, jumps, and focuses on key elements that stand out. Readers follow predictable patterns when scanning text. They start with the most prominent elements—headlines, large text, bold elements—then move to secondary information.

The concept of "visual weight" is crucial. Visual weight refers to how much attention an element draws based on its size, color, contrast, and positioning. Elements with higher visual weight naturally attract more attention.

The key insight: typography for focus must work with human psychology, not against it.

## Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is the foundation of effective typography. It organizes information by importance, using typographic elements to create clear levels of attention.

**Size** is the most powerful tool. Larger elements naturally draw more attention. Use size strategically to communicate importance.

**Font weight** creates emphasis. Bold text draws attention. Use it sparingly for the most important information.

**Color and contrast** create visual separation. High contrast makes elements stand out. Use it strategically to support the overall hierarchy.

**Position** creates structure. Elements that are aligned create visual connections. Elements positioned prominently naturally draw more attention.

All typographic elements should work together to create a coherent system.

## Typeface Selection

The choice of typeface has a significant impact on how readers process text. Different typefaces have different personalities and characteristics.

Serif typefaces are often associated with tradition and readability in long-form text. Sans-serif typefaces are often associated with modernity and clarity.

The key is to choose typefaces that work well together and support the communication goals. Consider the context and medium when selecting typefaces. Digital interfaces may require different choices than print materials.

## Spacing and Rhythm

Spacing is one of the most powerful tools for creating typography that focuses attention. The space around and between text elements creates visual breathing room and guides the eye.

**Line spacing** affects readability. Tighter spacing creates a more compact feel. Looser spacing creates a more open feel. Find the right balance.

**Paragraph spacing** creates visual separation. Consistent spacing creates rhythm and flow.

**White space** creates focus. Generous white space around important elements makes them stand out.

The key insight: spacing should create visual rhythm and flow that supports the information architecture.

## Color and Contrast

High contrast between text and background creates visual separation. Black text on white background provides the highest contrast and is generally the most readable.

Color can emphasize important information. The 60-30-10 rule is useful: 60% dominant color (usually neutral), 30% secondary color, 10% accent color.

Accessibility is crucial. Ensure color isn't the only way to convey important information, and maintain sufficient contrast ratios.

## Digital Considerations

Typography for digital interfaces requires different considerations than print. Screen resolution affects how typefaces render. Digital interfaces require typefaces optimized for screen display.

Responsive design requires typography that can adapt to different screen sizes. This might include fluid typography that scales with the viewport.

Reading patterns differ between digital and print. Digital readers tend to scan more and read less deeply. This requires typography optimized for scanning and quick comprehension.

The key insight: typography for digital interfaces requires different approaches than print. Adapt typography for the unique characteristics of digital media.

## The Principle

Effective typography requires understanding the content and user needs. It guides attention to what matters most.

The best typography doesn't just look good—it creates a clear path through information and helps users understand what matters most. When typography is designed for focus, it becomes a powerful tool for communication.
