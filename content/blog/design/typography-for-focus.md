Great typography is invisible until it needs to speak.

## Rules of thumb
- Use one family; two weights; three sizes.
- Increase line‑height before font size.
- Contrast with casing and spacing, not color.

## Patterns
- Title (600/32) → Section (500/24) → Body (400/16).
- 66–80 character line length for reading.
- Tabular numerals for dates and stats.

## How to apply
- Drop your body size by 1pt and raise line‑height by 0.2.
- Replace bold paragraphs with normal weight + spacing.
- Use small caps for metadata, never for body.
