Good hierarchy reduces thinking time.

## Principles
- One focal point per screen.
- Contrast with size, weight, and space (not colors alone).
- Align edges; align meanings.

## Checklist
- Can a first‑time user find the primary action in 3s?
- Do headings earn their size difference?
- Is spacing consistent (8px or 4px scale)?

## How to apply
- Reduce H1 by one step; increase whitespace instead.
- Demote low‑value UI (secondary text, subtle dividers).
- Use one accent color; use weight and spacing for the rest.
