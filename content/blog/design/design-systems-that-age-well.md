A design system is a change management tool.

## Start small
- Tokenize space, color, and type.
- Document 10 components you actually use.
- Version changes; keep a changelog.

## Keep it alive
- Pair designers and engineers on reviews.
- Capture intent behind decisions.
- Deprecate fast; keep one blessed way.

## How to apply
- Add tokens for spacing and type scale today.
- Write guidance for buttons, inputs, and cards.
- Ship a 1‑page “how to contribute” doc.
