Shipping is not heroism. It is the predictable outcome of a team that reduces drag in decision‑making, execution, and learning. This operating system is the minimal set of defaults that keeps momentum high and quality higher.

## The Core: Reduce Drag, Not Add Power

Most orgs respond to slowdowns with more meetings, more process, more people. That adds power; it rarely removes drag. Focus on friction: unclear ownership, slow decisions, and work waiting for review.

## Defaults for Common Decisions

- Small PRs behind feature flags
- Gradual rollouts with canaries
- “Write before you build” one‑page docs
- Reversible decisions preferred

See: [Design Docs That Work](../tech/design-docs-that-work.md).

## The Two‑Pass Review

1) Safety and scope: minimal, reversible, behind a flag.
2) Taste and consistency: naming, intent, fit.

If feedback requires redesign, move to a short doc; don’t litigate architecture in a PR thread.

## Ownership Over Handoffs

Replace borders with outcomes. One owner is accountable end‑to‑end and orchestrates contributors across product, backend, and frontend.

## Rituals That Compound

- Monday: 30‑minute planning with small, clear bets
- Daily: 10‑minute flow review to unblock work
- Friday: ship review—celebrate and improve one step in the loop

## Metrics That Matter

- Cycle time: start to production
- Review wait time: request to first review
- Rollback rate: safety proxy
- Lead time per bet: planning to outcome

## Tooling and Safeguards

- Pre‑commit quality gates (lint, type checks)
- CI budgets for performance and bundle size
- Feature flags for safe experimentation
- Observability: logs, traces, and user‑perceived performance

See: [Performance, First Principles](../tech/performance-first-principles.md).

## Operating with Docs, Not Meetings

Short, opinionated docs win. Start with problem, options, decision, and risks. Keep them living during rollout; close with an ADR.

## Onboarding New Teammates

- A 30‑minute architecture tour
- A “first week” checklist with one small shipped change
- A glossary of domain concepts and shared names

## Anti‑Patterns

- Architectural debates in PR threads
- Big‑bang rewrites without flags
- Ownership dissolved across committees

## How to Apply This Week

- Measure baseline cycle time and review wait time
- Add a daily 10‑minute unblocker standup
- Require a one‑page doc for non‑trivial changes

Shipping becomes a habit when the right move is the easy move.
