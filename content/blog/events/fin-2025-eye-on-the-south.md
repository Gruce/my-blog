Every generation has a turning point.  
For Iraq, that moment is now — and it begins in the South.

**FIN25** wasn’t just a conference.  
It was a signal.  
A call to focus our energy, our ideas, and our creativity on what truly matters:  
building a future that works for people.

## A New Kind of Alignment

Something rare happened at *Eye on the South*.  
Government, business, and innovators sat at one table — not to debate, but to **build**.  
They shared a simple belief:  
growth is not a dream; it’s a decision.

The South is no longer an untapped region.  
It’s the heart of Iraq’s next chapter —  
where ambition meets possibility.

## Building the Foundation

When we talk about development, we talk about people first.  
And behind every thriving community lies an invisible foundation:  
**energy**, **movement**, and **connection**.

- **Energy** that’s efficient, intelligent, and sustainable.  
- **Transport** that moves goods as fast as ideas.  
- **Finance** that empowers small businesses to dream bigger.  

Each of these isn’t a sector — it’s a story.  
Together, they form the pulse of Basra, Maysan, and Dhi Qar.

## Why Basra Matters

Basra is more than a city — it’s a signal of what’s next.  
It holds the infrastructure, the youth, the proximity, and the potential.  

We spoke about **5G readiness**, not as a technology,  
but as a bridge —  
connecting logistics, ports, finance, and people in real time.  

Basra has always been the gateway.  
Now, it becomes the network.

## Partners with Purpose

The future isn’t built alone.  
It’s built together — with those who see what others don’t.  

To **Tafa3ul Group**, thank you for the clarity of vision.  
To **Asiacell** and **Asas Platform**, thank you for turning connection into progress.  

Partnership isn’t just collaboration.  
It’s shared intent —  
to raise the standard of what’s possible.

## Toward 2025 and Beyond

In 2025, we launched programs that felt different:  
less about presentations, more about *practice*.  

Workshops on AI, digital marketing, design, and entrepreneurship.  
Real teams. Real products.  
Real people growing skills that will shape the digital economy.  

Because in the South, the equation is simple:

> **Infrastructure + Talent = Transformation.**

## What Happens Next

1. **Energy:** Smarter grids. Predictive systems. Local innovation.  
2. **Logistics:** Digital ports. Transparent trade. Seamless movement.  
3. **Finance:** New rails for SMEs. Trust built on data.  
4. **Networks:** 5G corridors that follow ambition, not geography.  
5. **Talent:** Bootcamps that turn learners into builders.  

The work has already begun.  
And it won’t stop here.

## The South — Not an Idea, but a Direction

This is more than an event recap.  
It’s a reminder.  
That progress is built, not announced.  
That every connection, every startup, every idea born in Basra moves us all forward.

The South isn’t waiting for the future.  
It **is** the future.  
And we’re building it — one bold idea at a time.
