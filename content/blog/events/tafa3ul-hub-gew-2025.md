## When Entrepreneurship Meets Action: GEW 2025

Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) is more than a calendar event—it's a worldwide movement that celebrates and empowers entrepreneurs. In November 2025, Tafa3ul Hub joined this global celebration, hosting a comprehensive week of activities designed to inspire, educate, and connect the next generation of entrepreneurs in Iraq.

This wasn't just another networking event. It was a carefully curated experience that brought together experienced mentors, inspiring speakers, and ambitious entrepreneurs to create something meaningful. As a tech mentor during the week, I witnessed firsthand how these connections transformed ideas into actionable plans and how guidance from experienced professionals helped participants navigate the complex journey of building a business.

## Understanding Global Entrepreneurship Week

Global Entrepreneurship Week, founded in 2008, has grown into the world's largest celebration of innovators and job creators. Each November, millions of people across 200+ countries participate in tens of thousands of activities, events, and competitions designed to help them explore their potential as self-starters and innovators.


### The GEW Mission

GEW's mission is simple but powerful: **to inspire people everywhere to unleash their ideas and turn them into reality**. The week serves as a catalyst for:

- **Connecting Entrepreneurs**: Bringing together people with ideas and people with resources
- **Mentorship**: Providing access to experienced mentors who can guide the journey
- **Education**: Offering workshops, panels, and sessions that teach practical skills
- **Inspiration**: Sharing stories of success and failure that motivate action
- **Community Building**: Creating networks that last long after the week ends

### Why GEW Matters in Iraq

In Iraq's evolving economic landscape, entrepreneurship represents more than business creation—it represents hope, opportunity, and the potential for transformation. GEW provides a structured framework for:

1. **Building Ecosystems**: Connecting isolated entrepreneurs into a supportive community

## The Mentorship Experience: Tech Mentoring in Action

As a tech mentor during GEW 2025, I had the opportunity to work directly with entrepreneurs who were building technology-enabled businesses or looking to integrate technology into traditional business models. This experience revealed both the challenges and opportunities facing entrepreneurs in Iraq's tech ecosystem.

### Common Challenges Addressed

**Technology Selection and Architecture**

Many entrepreneurs came with ideas but needed guidance on technology choices. Common questions included:

- Which technology stack is right for my product?
- How do I balance speed of development with scalability?
- What's the minimum viable technology to get started?
- How do I build a team with the right technical skills?

The mentorship sessions focused on helping entrepreneurs make informed technology decisions based on their specific needs, resources, and timelines. We discussed everything from choosing between different frameworks to understanding when to build custom solutions versus using existing platforms.

**Product Development Strategy**

Beyond technology choices, entrepreneurs needed help understanding how to approach product development:

- How do I prioritize features for an MVP?
- What's the right balance between perfection and shipping?
- How do I validate technical assumptions?
- What metrics should I track to measure product success?

These conversations often revealed that the biggest challenge wasn't technical—it was strategic. Many entrepreneurs needed help understanding how to break down their vision into actionable development phases.

**Team and Resource Management**

Building a tech-enabled business requires more than just technical skills. Entrepreneurs needed guidance on:

- How to hire and manage technical talent
- When to outsource versus build in-house
- How to work effectively with developers and designers
- What technical roles are essential at different stages
