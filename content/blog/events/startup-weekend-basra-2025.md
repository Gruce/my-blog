Startup Weekend Basra 2025 is a 54-hour event where entrepreneurs, developers, and designers come together to build startups from scratch. It's a weekend of intense collaboration, rapid prototyping, and real-world learning.

## The Format

The weekend follows a simple format:

- **Friday**: Pitch ideas, form teams, start building.

- **Saturday**: Build, iterate, get feedback.

- **Sunday**: Present to judges, get feedback, celebrate.

In 54 hours, teams go from idea to working prototype to presentation.

## The Experience

Startup Weekend is about more than building a startup. It's about:

- **Learning**: Learning what it takes to build a startup.

- **Networking**: Meeting other entrepreneurs, developers, and designers.

- **Validation**: Testing your idea with real users and judges.

- **Fun**: Having fun while building something meaningful.

## The Impact

Many Startup Weekend participants have gone on to build successful startups. Some have raised funding. Others have built profitable businesses. All have learned valuable lessons about entrepreneurship.

The key is the intensity. In 54 hours, you learn more about building a startup than you would in months of reading.

## The Principle

Great startups are built by teams, not individuals. Startup Weekend brings together entrepreneurs, developers, and designers to build startups in 54 hours. When people with different skills come together, they create something greater than the sum of their parts.
