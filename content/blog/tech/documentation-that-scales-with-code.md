title: Documentation That Scales with Code

Docs rot when theyâ€™re separate from decisions.

## Keep close
- README per module
- ADRs for irreversible choices
- Inline examples over prose

Make the next change obvious.

## How to apply
- Add a README and usage example to one module today.
- Record one ADR for a recent irreversible decision.
- Replace a long paragraph with a runnable snippet.
