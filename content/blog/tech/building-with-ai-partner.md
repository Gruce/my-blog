Treat AI like a junior engineer with superpowers.

## Workflow
- Describe intent and constraints
- Ask for options, not answers
- Review diffs like always

You own taste and direction. Keep it that way.

## How to apply
- Frame tasks with intent, constraints, and examples before asking.
- Compare 2â€“3 AI options; select, then refine.
- Land changes via PR with tests and a short rationale.
