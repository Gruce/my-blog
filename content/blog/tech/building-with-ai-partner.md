AI is changing how we build software. It's not about replacing developers—it's about augmenting them. When done right, AI becomes a powerful partner that helps you build better software faster.

## The Partnership Model

AI works best as a partner, not a replacement. You bring domain knowledge, judgment, and creativity. AI brings speed, pattern recognition, and tireless execution.

The key is to use AI for what it's good at—repetitive tasks, pattern matching, code generation—while you focus on what you're good at—problem-solving, architecture, judgment.

## Core Principles

**Clarity over cleverness**: Be clear about what you want. AI works better with clear instructions than clever tricks.

**Iteration over perfection**: Start with something that works, then improve it. Don't try to get it perfect on the first try.

**Review over trust**: Always review AI-generated code. Don't trust it blindly. Use it as a starting point, not a final product.

**Learning over automation**: Use AI to learn, not just to automate. Ask it to explain things. Use it to understand patterns.

## Practical Patterns

**Code generation**: Use AI to generate boilerplate, tests, and common patterns. Review and refine the output.

**Code explanation**: Use AI to explain complex code. Ask it to break down what code does and why.

**Refactoring assistance**: Use AI to suggest refactorings. Review suggestions and apply the ones that make sense.

**Documentation**: Use AI to generate documentation. Review and refine to ensure accuracy.

## The Workflow

1. **Define the problem**: Be clear about what you're trying to build.

2. **Generate initial code**: Use AI to generate a starting point.

3. **Review and refine**: Review the code, understand it, and refine it.

4. **Test and iterate**: Test the code, fix issues, and iterate.

5. **Learn and improve**: Learn from the process and improve your prompts.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-reliance**: Don't rely on AI for everything. Use it as a tool, not a crutch.

- **Lack of review**: Always review AI-generated code. Don't trust it blindly.

- **Poor prompts**: Be clear about what you want. Vague prompts lead to poor results.

- **Ignoring context**: AI doesn't understand your full context. You need to provide it.

## The Principle

AI is a powerful partner when used correctly. Use it for what it's good at—speed, pattern recognition, code generation—while you focus on what you're good at—problem-solving, architecture, judgment. Always review AI-generated code. Use it as a starting point, not a final product.
