description: "A practical playbook for partnering with AI at work: frame intent, explore options, and keep human taste and direction in charge."
---

Treat AI like a junior teammate with superpowers. It moves fast, it never tires, and it follows your lead. Your job is to set intent, define constraints, and maintain taste. The outcome is better work in less time—without losing judgment.

## Mindset and Principles

- **You own direction**: AI accelerates execution; humans set goals and taste
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Clear intent beats clever prompts
- **Small steps**: Short cycles reduce risk and improve learning
- **Transparency**: Label AI-assisted work; invite review
- **Ethics first**: Respect privacy, security, and attribution

## Framing Requests That Work

Every effective request includes four parts:
- **Intent**: What outcome you want and why it matters
- **Constraints**: Scope, non-goals, style, tone, or boundaries
- **Context**: Brief background and relevant examples
- **Acceptance**: How you’ll judge success

## Options, Not Answers

Ask for 2–3 distinct approaches. Compare trade‑offs, pick a direction, and refine. You get better ideas and avoid tunnel vision.

## Review and Acceptance

Hold AI to the same bar as teammates:
- **Completeness**: Does it meet the acceptance criteria?
- **Coherence**: Is the reasoning sound and consistent?
- **Fit**: Does it match voice, brand, and strategy?
- **Risks**: Any privacy, security, or compliance concerns?

## Collaboration Rituals

- **Daily**: 10‑minute intent framing before asking for help
- **Mid‑task**: Option review to avoid sunk costs
- **End‑task**: Acceptance check and brief summary of decisions

## Quality Guardrails

- **Source boundaries**: Avoid pasting sensitive data; sanitize inputs
- **Attribution**: Track what was AI‑assisted vs. human authored
- **Review queues**: Route AI‑assisted work for peer review
- **Red lines**: Define what AI must never do in your context

## Team Patterns

- **Research assistant**: Summarize, cluster, and compare sources
- **Draft collaborator**: Produce a first pass to edit and tighten
- **Critique partner**: Ask it to find gaps or counterexamples
- **Checklists**: Use AI to generate and maintain checklists

## Pitfalls and Safeguards

- **Over‑reliance**: Keep critical thinking and domain expertise in the loop
- **Hallucinations**: Require citations for facts; verify before using
- **Style drift**: Maintain a style guide and examples for alignment
- **Scope creep**: Reinforce constraints when outputs expand the brief

## Weekly Operating Loop

1. Identify 3 tasks where AI can create leverage
2. Write intent/constraints for each and collect 2–3 options
3. Select, refine, and ship with human review
4. Capture wins, misses, and prompt patterns in a living guide

Use AI for speed; keep humans for sense. You own taste and direction—keep it that way.
