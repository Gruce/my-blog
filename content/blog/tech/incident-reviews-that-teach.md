Incidents are the most expensive lessons you’ll ever get for free. A good review turns pain into practice and leaves the system stronger than before.

## What “blameless” actually means
Blameless is not causeless. It means we look at context and systems, not personal failings. Ask what made the error easy, not who made it.

## Run the review like this
1) Reconstruct the timeline using facts (logs, alerts, dashboards). Avoid hindsight bias by recording what was knowable at the time.

2) Analyze decisions and signals. What cues were missed? What playbooks were missing? Where did tooling slow us down?

3) Produce systemic fixes. Prefer changes to alerts, runbooks, dashboards, and guardrails over “be more careful.”

## A short template
- Summary and impact
- Timeline of events
- Contributing factors (technical and organizational)
- Actions (prevention and detection)

Make learning the deliverable. Then verify it landed.

## How to apply
- Schedule the review within 72 hours; cap at 60 minutes.
- Record facts first, then analysis; assign 3 systemic actions.
- Revisit actions in 30 days and confirm changes stuck.
