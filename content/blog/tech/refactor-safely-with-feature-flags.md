Flags turn risk into sequence.

## Use flags to
- Gate new paths
- Compare outputs
- Roll back instantly

Delete old flags quickly. They rot.

## How to apply
- Introduce a killâ€‘switch for the new code path.
- Compare old vs new outputs in logs for one endpoint.
- Schedule a flag cleanup two releases after rollout.
