Frontend architecture is the art of managing state, data, and time without leaking that complexity to the user. The goal is not a perfect abstraction; it’s a system that stays understandable as it grows.

## A Mental Model

Every screen does three things: fetch data, represent state, and respond to user intent. Make each explicit. Hidden work becomes hidden bugs.

## Data and State

- Co‑locate data fetching and derived state near the component that renders it
- Globalize only when multiple screens need the same source of truth
- Prefer simple, predictable state over clever reducers and magic effects

## Contracts and Boundaries

Treat API shapes as interfaces. Agree on shapes, mock them, and fail loudly when they drift. Boundaries create independence and speed.

## Caching for UX

Cache the queries that block interaction. Stale‑while‑revalidate beats spinners and keeps the interface responsive.

## Composition over Complexity

Compose small components into bigger ones. Avoid deep inheritance and implicit behavior. If a newcomer can’t trace the flow in five minutes, it won’t survive a rewrite.

## Testing the Flows

Test the happy path and critical edge cases for user journeys. Focus on behavior and contracts, not internal implementation details.

## Team Practices

- Document core flows and shared contracts
- Keep examples close to components
- Review PRs for accidental complexity

Good frontend architecture makes tomorrow’s change obvious.
