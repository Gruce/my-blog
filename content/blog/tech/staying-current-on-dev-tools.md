Tools change weekly; your problems don’t. Stay current by curating inputs and testing tools against real friction.

4. [Team Signals](#team-signals)
5. [Adoption Criteria](#adoption-criteria)

## Curate the Feed

Follow release notes, a few maintainers, and trusted communities. Keep inputs small and high‑signal.

## Evaluate with Problems

Test tools against your top three pain points. If they don’t reduce friction, pass.

## Pilot, Don’t Commit

Run time‑boxed pilots with success criteria. Document outcomes and a clear yes/no.

## Team Signals

Watch onboarding time, incident rates, and cycle time. If a tool helps these, it’s worth a look.

## Adoption Criteria

- Clear win on a real problem
- Acceptable cost and lock‑in
- Team readiness and ownership

Adopt when it removes friction.
