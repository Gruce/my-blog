Small bets compound. Thin slices reduce risk, speed learning, and keep teams moving.

## Why It Works

- Lower risk per change
- Faster feedback on real usage
- Easier reversals when wrong

## How to Slice

Ship the smallest end‑to‑end path that delivers value. Avoid horizontal slices that don’t help users.

## Feedback Loops

Shorten the loop: telemetry, quick reviews, and regular ship reviews. Capture one improvement each week.

## Measuring Learning

Track what changed, what was learned, and what you’ll do next. Learning is the deliverable.

## Anti-Patterns

- Mega‑PRs that hide risk
- Roadmaps without feedback built in
- “All‑or‑nothing” launches

Keep the bet small, the loop tight, the learning explicit.
