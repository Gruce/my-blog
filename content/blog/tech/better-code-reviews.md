Reviews improve code and culture.

## Focus the review
- What changed and why
- Edge cases
- Naming and intent

Be kind, be specific, be brief.

## How to apply
- Limit PRs to one intent and <300 lines of diff.
- Use a checklist: scope, safety, naming, tests.
- Ask one clarifying question and make one concrete suggestion.
