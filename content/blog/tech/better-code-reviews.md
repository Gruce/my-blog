Code reviews are the heartbeat of software quality. They're where knowledge spreads, bugs are caught, and architectural decisions are validated. But too often, they become a bottleneck that slows teams down and creates friction between developers.

The difference between great and mediocre code reviews isn't just about technical skills—it's about process, communication, and culture.

## Why Code Reviews Matter

Code reviews serve multiple critical functions:

**Quality Assurance**: Studies show that code reviews catch 60-90% of bugs before they reach production. They catch logical errors, edge cases, and integration issues that automated tests might miss.

**Knowledge Transfer**: Reviews spread knowledge across the team. They help people understand the codebase and learn from each other.

**Architecture Validation**: Reviews ensure that new code fits well with existing architecture and follows established patterns.

**Team Culture**: Reviews build trust and collaboration. They create opportunities for learning and growth.

## Core Principles

**Fast feedback**: Reviews should be fast. The longer code sits in review, the more context is lost and the harder it is to change.

**Constructive feedback**: Feedback should be constructive and helpful. Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the author.

**Clear communication**: Be clear about what you're asking for and why. Don't leave the author guessing.

**Respectful tone**: Be respectful and kind. Code reviews are about improving code, not proving superiority.

## The Review Process

**Small changes**: Keep changes small. Small changes are easier to review and understand.

**Clear context**: Provide clear context about what you're changing and why. Help reviewers understand the problem you're solving.

**Focused feedback**: Focus on what matters. Don't bikeshed on style. Focus on correctness, architecture, and maintainability.

**Quick turnaround**: Review quickly. If you can't review within 24 hours, say so. Don't let code sit in review.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Nitpicking**: Don't focus on minor style issues. Focus on what matters.

- **Vague feedback**: Be specific about what you want changed and why.

- **Personal attacks**: Keep feedback focused on the code, not the person.

- **Blocking on style**: Don't block reviews on style issues. Use linters and formatters instead.

## The Principle

Code reviews are about improving code and spreading knowledge. Keep them fast, constructive, and respectful. Focus on what matters—correctness, architecture, and maintainability. Use them to build better software and stronger teams.
