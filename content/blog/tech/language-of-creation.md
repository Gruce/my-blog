title: The New Language of Creation
---

A few tools don’t just speed us up — they change how we work. 
For years we told computers exactly what to do. Now they can meet us halfway.

## Vibe coding
We used to write syntax. Now we express intent. 
You describe what you want; the system moves toward it. 
Less friction between thought and creation.

## The developer’s job
The role shifts from mechanic to composer. 
We shape direction, constraints, and taste. 
We spend less time on keywords and more on meaning.

## What to optimize
Not more code — more clarity. 
Not more features — more fit. 
The question isn’t only “does it work?” but “does it feel right?”

## Where we’re headed
AI won’t replace developers; it will remove limits. 
That gives us room to design better ideas, not just bigger systems.

The best software reads like intention. The best tools disappear.
