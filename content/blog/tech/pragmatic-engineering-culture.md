Principles beat process. The best engineering cultures bias for action, make learning cheap, and measure outcomes—not activity.

## Small Bets

Ship in thin slices. Short feedback loops compound learning and reduce risk.

## Measure Outcomes

Track user and business impact: adoption, task success, reliability. Activity metrics (PRs, lines) are noise.

## Clarity over Cleverness

Prefer simple designs with clear names. Optimize for future readers.

## Defaults and Rituals

- Weekly planning: pick 3 small bets
- Daily flow review: unblock what’s stuck
- Friday ship review: celebrate, then improve the loop

## Hiring and Growth

Hire for judgment and communication. Grow with mentorship and hands‑on ownership.

## Anti-Patterns

- Process cargo‑culting
- Hero culture and hidden work
- Architecture by committee with no owner

Culture is what you do when the doc is missing.
