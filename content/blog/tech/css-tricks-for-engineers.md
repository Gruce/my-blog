CSS that scales is more about systems than tricks. The goal isn’t clever selectors—it’s predictable styles, fast iteration, and a codebase that stays maintainable as teams grow.

## Principles that Scale

- **Consistency over cleverness**
- **Explicit over implicit**
- **Composition over cascade**
- **Constraints enable speed**

## Utility-First as a Default

Start with utilities for 80% of cases. They’re explicit, compressible, and easy to grep. Reserve abstractions for repeated patterns with real semantics.

## Components and Overrides

Use components for patterns with names and meaning (e.g., Card, Alert). Keep overrides local and documented. Prefer composition to deep, fragile selectors.

## Design Tokens

Use tokens for spacing, color, radius, and shadows. Tokens connect design decisions to implementation and make change safer.

## Layout and Spacing Systems

Pick a spacing scale (4px/8px). Use containers and stacks to create predictable rhythm. Avoid arbitrary gaps; align to the scale.

## Typography and Color

Define a small, intentional type scale and a restrained color palette. Use weight and spacing for hierarchy; use color sparingly for meaning.

## Avoiding Style Drift

- Limit custom CSS in components; prefer utilities
- Review diffs for new ad‑hoc values that break the scale
- Centralize tokens; avoid one‑off variables

## Team Practices

- **Starter kit**: Ship a base stylesheet, tokens, and examples
- **Lint rules**: Catch forbidden values and deep selectors
- **Docs**: Short guidelines with before/after visuals

Consistency beats cleverness. Build a system, enforce a scale, and let the code read like intent.
