description: "Use Stack Overflow as a learning engine: ask better questions, explain trade‑offs, and teach in public to level up faster."

The best answers show the why. Treat Stack Overflow as a place to practice clear thinking, not just hunt for snippets. Ask well, explain your trade‑offs, and close the loop—your future self (and others) will thank you.

## Ask Better Questions

- Describe intent, not just the error
- Share what you tried and why it failed
- Provide the minimal context needed to reason

## Explain Trade-Offs

When you find an answer, note the constraints: performance, readability, portability, and maintenance. Capture when each approach is appropriate.

## Teach in Public

Write a short summary of what worked and why. Include the gotcha you hit and how you avoided it. Teaching cements understanding.

## Give Back

- Upvote great explanations and say why
- Add clarifying comments that improve the answer
- Post your solution if you found a better path

## Personal Knowledge Base

Collect your best Q&A in a personal doc. Tag by topic and revisit monthly to connect patterns. Learning compounds when it’s organized.

Use public questions to sharpen your thinking. You’ll learn faster—and help others along the way.
