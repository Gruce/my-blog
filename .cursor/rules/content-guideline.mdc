# Content That Ranks

*Simple. Deep. Valuable.*

---

## The Core

**Write for humans first. Search engines second.**

Create content so valuable that people want to read it, share it, and return to it. That's how you rank.

---

## Front Matter

```yaml
---
date: 2025-01-15
title: "Short Title with Keyword"
tags: [one, two, three] # Max 3, single words only
image: /og/filename.png
category: tech # tech, design, events, or startup
series: "Series Name" # Optional
seriesOrder: 1 # Optional
description: "150-160 chars with value prop"
---
```

**Rules:**
- Title: As brief as possible. As smart as possible. 50 chars max.
- Tags: 3 max, one word each
- Description: 150-160 chars
- Category: Must match taxonomy

---

## Structure

**Start with the problem.** People search because they have a problem.

**Show you understand.** Use specific examples, real code, actual experiences.

**Solve it completely.** Answer every question. Leave nothing unanswered.

**Make it actionable.** Every section should teach something usable.

---

## Depth

**3,000-5,000 words minimum.** Not fluff. Substance.

Every word earns its place. Every section adds value. Every example teaches.

---

## SEO

**Keywords in title, first paragraph, naturally throughout.**

**Proper headings.** H2 for major sections. H3 for subsections. Clear hierarchy.

**Internal links.** Connect related content. 3-5 contextual links per article.

**Structured data.** Already handled by Nuxt. Just use the schema.

---

## Quality

**Code examples work.** Test them.

**Facts are accurate.** Verify everything.

**Examples are real.** No hypotheticals. Real projects, real results.

**Voice is consistent.** Write like you're talking to a colleague who's smart but new to the topic.

---

## Series

**Group related articles.** Use `series` and `seriesOrder` fields.

**First article visible.** Others collapsible. Clean. Organized.

---

## The Test

Before publishing, ask:

1. **Would I bookmark this?** If not, rewrite.
2. **Does it solve the problem completely?** If not, add more.
3. **Is every word necessary?** If not, cut it.

**Simple. Deep. Valuable.**

That's it.
